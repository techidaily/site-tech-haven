### 2 ways to update device drivers in Windows

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-update-drivers-after-upgrading-to-windows-10/#method2)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1: Update Drivers Manually \[Step by Step\]

 1\. Open Windows 10 Device Manager by pressing **Win+X** (the Windows logo key![windows key 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/windows-key-3.png) and the X key) at the same time and clicking **Device Manager** .

 2\. In the Device Manager window, expand the categories and locate the device that you wish to update the driver for.  
 In this example, I choose**Intel Wireless Bluetooth** which is the model of my on-board Bluetooth adapter. To identify the Bluetooth adapter, one common method is to look for the name that starts with a manufacturer (e.g. Intel, Qualcomm or Realtek) and ends with a “Bluetooth”.  
 Once you found the correct Bluetooth device, right-click the device and in the drop down menu, select**Update driver** .

 3\. In the pop-up window, you’ll see two options. Click**Search automatically for updated driver software** . ![update graphics card driver using the Device Manager](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/search-automatically-for-updated-software.jpg)

 4\. Windows will try to find and install drivers for your device automatically. In some cases, you will see a prompt saying that**The best drivers for your device are already installed** .

 But it**DOES NOT** mean you have the latest driver. Windows may not be able to give you the latest driver since it involves third-party manufacturers. At the time of writing, Windows tells me I currently have the best driver (Ver 23.20.0.3), but it turns out there’s already a newer driver (Ver 23.50.0) on the manufacturer’s website.

 **If you’re troubleshooting a driver issue, it could be crucial to make sure you have the latest device drivers.** You can go to each manufacturer’s website, manually search for the drivers for your device model, and install the drivers one by one.

 Or you can use the following method to update all the device drivers safely and automatically.

### Option 2: Update Drivers Automatically
