## Quick Guide: Turn Off Driver Signature Protection in Windows 11 Without Hassle

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_58b52a003bb57.jpg)

 On Windows 8 and Windows 10 (64-bit), Microsoft has included a feature,**driver signature enforcement** . It is a feature that is designed to ensure that users of Microsoft can only load drivers that have been signed by Microsoft.

 As much security driver signature enforcement brings us, it does also bring with it some inconveniences. For instance, when you want to use some less official drivers, old unsigned drivers or drivers developed by yourself, this feature needs to be disabled first before you can move on.

 In this post, we will show you two different methods to disable this feature by yourself.

**NOTE** : Please be aware that disabling this feature and using or installing driver that were not officially signed could cause damage to your PC. Please only do so when you fully understand what you are about to do.

[**Method One: Enable Test Signing Mode**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[**Method Two: Advanced Boot Option**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 **Method One: Enable Test Signing Mode**

 This method allows you to disable driver signature enforcement**completely** if you donâ€™t enable it again manually.

 1) Press**Windows key** and**X** at the same time, then choose**Command Prompt(Admin)** from the list of choice.

 When prompted with administrator permission, just click**Yes** to move on.

 2) In the command prompt window, type in the following command:

bcdedit /set testsigning on

 Make sure you have made no typo and hit**Enter** .

 3) Restart your computer to enter test mode. You will be able to see the watermark saying**Test Mode** on the bottom right corner of your desktop.

 Now you can install or use the driver you want.

 4) If you want to leave Test Mode, repeat step 1) to enter Command Prompt with administrative permission. Then in the command prompt window, type in the following command:

bcedit /set testsigning off

 Make sure you have made no typo and hit**Enter** .

 Then restart your computer into normal mode.

**Method Two: Advanced Boot Option**

 This method allows you to shut off driver signature enforcement feature for once. It is not a permanent change. Restart your computer and this feature is back on again.

 1) Press**Start** button, and then click the icon for Restart and Shut down. Now, press and hold**Shift** key when you choose**Restart** .
