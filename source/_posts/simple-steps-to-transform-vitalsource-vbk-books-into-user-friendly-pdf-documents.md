Every now and then, students and researchers purchase textbooks from Vitalsource Bookshelf. Most of the books downloaded from VitalSource Bookshelf are in VBK format and protected by DRM. People only can open these books with VitalSource Bookshelf APP which is really annoying. Recently I have received many readers emails which inquiry if there is any way to convert VBK to PDF. I've tested some methods posted on these famous ebook related forums and find the easiest way to convert VBK to PDF. This method will cost you no penny!

**Update:** Since there are many readers want to convert the VBK to pdf in whole, we launch a new software--**[Epubor VitalSource Downloader](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)** to download the VitalSource eTextbooks to PDF/EPUB.

### Convert VBK to PDF on Mac

If you are Mac user, converting VBK to PDF is a piece of cake for you. Most of you may do not know that Mac comes pre-installed with a PDF printer. With this built-in printer, it is easy for us convert VitalSource book to PDF.

#### Step 1: Install VitalSource Bookshelf APP on your Mac

To Print the book, first of all, we have to open this book on your Mac. Please go to the official site of [VitalSource Bookshelf](https://www.vitalsource.com)to download the desktop app and install it. Then download the books you want to print via VitalSource Bookshelf app.

#### Step 2: Print VitalSource VBK file to PDF

Open the book you want to print, then choose "Print" at the dropdown list of "File“ option at the top toolbar. 

![print vbk to pdf](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/print-vbk-to-pdf-1.png)

It will pop up a new window asking you to fill in the range of the pages you want to print. In this window, you will see that if there is print limitations. If yes, we can not bypass the limitations for now. Ignore this restriction and just click on "continue" to go to the next step. 

![choose the page range](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/choose-the-page-range.png)

The print window will pop up. Now you can fill in the copies, pages you want to print. At the buttom, you will see PDF options, click on "PDF" and select ”Save as PDF" at the dropdown list.

![save vbk as pdf](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/save-as-pdf.png)

 Fill in the "Title", "Author", and choose the storages place for the converted PDF file. Then click on " Save" to generate the PDF file.

![conver vbk to pdf on mac](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-vbk-to-pdf-2.png)

Now you get your VBK file converted to PDF. Since there may be print limitations, you may have to follow the above guide to print the rest pages. When all pages has been printed to PDF, you can merge them to one PDF file with [Epubor PDF & Merger & Splitter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/pdf-splitter-merger/). Now you can get a full book.

![save vbk as pdf](https://www.epubor.com/images/pdf-splitter-merger.htmlscreen1.png)

### Convert VBK to PDF on Windows

Unlike Mac, if you are using Windows system, there will not be a built-in printer preinstalled on your computer. As there are so many free PDF creation appliation on the market, why not install one on your Windows? I have used both doPDF and CutePDF. Both of them work well as a Virtual PDF printer on my own Windows.

#### Step 1: Install VitalSource Bookshelf app on your Windows

Go to [VitalSource Bookshelf](https://www.vitalsource.com)to download the desktop app and then install it on your Windows.

#### Step 2: Install doPDF on your computer

Download the FREE virtual printer driver doPDF [here.](https://dopdf-free-pdf-converter.soft112.com/quick-download.html) This virtual printer will allow you print files as regular printer, but the result will be a PDF, not a real paper.

#### Step 3: Print the VitalSource Books as PDF

Open the VitalSource Bookshelf and download the book you want to convert. Open the book and then click on "File"-->”“Print".

![print vbk to pdf](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/windows-print-VBK.png)

The print preview window will pop up. You just have to click on "print" to go to the next step. 

![print options on windows](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/print-options.png)

Now you will see the print settings window. Choose "doPDF 9" as the virtual printer and select all pages. Then click on "Print". 

![select printer for vitalsource book](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/select-printer.png)

After you have clicked on "Print", the doPDF will save this file as PDF. You can change the file name and storage at your computer by clicking on "Browse". Then click on "OK". The printer will begin to print this file and give you a PDF file.

![print vbk to pdf on windows](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/print-vbk-to-pdf-on-windows.png)

As there may be print limitation, you have to print the pages one by one. After all pages have been printed, you can use Epubor PDF & Merger & Splitter to merge all pdf files to one book.

This does work. You have to go to the section you want to save, then select print and the print range (max is 2 pages). This is not a real solution for books with several hundred pages though.

Good luck epubor. Can’t wait for you to resolve this. I have the book, why don’t they just listen their proprietary software sucks for simple reading and that’s why people don’t want to use it, not because we haven’t already day got the books!

 I want to run a pdf speed reader over it for a quick overview for the first read before a proper study... sigh.
