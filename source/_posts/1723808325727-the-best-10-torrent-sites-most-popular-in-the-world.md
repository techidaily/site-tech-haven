**Why are these sites the best torrent sites for gaming?** Actually, we’re not sure if these sites are the best for you. We choose them as the top game torrent sites because they have a high rank in Alexa, they provide high-quality game torrents, they’re free to use, and they have a user-friendly UI. We recommend you to try all of them, then you’ll find what’s the best for you.

 What is Alexa? Alexa is a global site ranking system. It updates daily based on how many unique visitors and page views a site has. The higher rank a site has on Alexa, the more visitors a site has. So you use Alexa to evaluate if a site is popular and trustworthy.

 Note: Some of the sites below may be blocked in your country. If you can’t access some sites, you can try to use a VPN, which can hide your IP address and allow you to access all torrent sites. See[Best VPNs for Torrenting](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

You can use the web version or the app version to download game torrents.

## IMPORTANT: Protect your privacy first

 Downloading torrents is perfectly legal, so long as the files you’re downloading aren’t protected under copyright.

**Downloading copyrighted shows, movies and music is illegal** , and can attract significant penalties. All the major studios actively track the IP addresses of the computers illegally downloading their works. They then contact the associated internet service providers (ISPs) and get them to trace that IP address back to you. In many countries, ISPs are legally obligated to tell the studios who you are. And even in countries where they’re _not_ legally obligated, many ISPs will share your details anyway, simply because it’s easier.

 If you plan to download copyrighted material,   **you should definitely use a VPN (which stands for ‘virtual private server’) so you can’t be tracked and prosecuted.** A VPN hides your IP address from prying eyes. Our favorite VPN is **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s fast and cheap, and – most importantly – it will keep your IP address hidden.
