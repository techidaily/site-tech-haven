![Apple iPhone 15](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/31dab4fb7eca3b39f241b30aaf514fb4a7030f03/2023/09/13/6ecb3064-f72e-48bb-924e-fbb230fa5401/iphone-15-meta-phone-photo.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

Apple's highly anticipated fall event happened earlier this week, which means there are plenty of new devices to shop. During the nearly two-hour event, Apple announced the latest iPhone 15 lineup, the Apple Watch Series 9, the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and technically new (but not really) AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case. 

It's important to note that all of the devices announced this week feature USB-C charging, something that Apple was forced to do by the European Union's decree that -- by the end of 2024 -- [all smartphones and tablets must use the same USB-C connector.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-will-get-usb-c-charging-as-apple-says-it-will-comply-with-eu-law/)

**Also:** [**Everything Apple just announced: iPhone 15, Apple Watch Ultra 2, AirPods**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-announced-today-iphone-15-apple-watch-ultra-2-airpods/)

Preorders for all the devices have already begun, with the iPhone 15 series, Apple Watches, and AirPods preorders on Friday, September 15, and open sales starting on Friday, September 22.

Here's where you can preorder the latest Apple products, as well as where to find the best deals to save on your investments.
