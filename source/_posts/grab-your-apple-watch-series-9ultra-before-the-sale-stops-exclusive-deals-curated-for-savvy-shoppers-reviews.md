This may be your last chance to snag savings on Apple's newest Series 9 and Ultra 2 models.

If you or a loved one is hoping to unwrap a new [Apple Watch Series 9](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-watch-series-9-gps-41mm-starlight-aluminum-case-with-starlight-sport-band-s-m-starlight%2F6340266.p%3FskuId%3D6340266&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) or [Apple Watch Ultra 2](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-watch-ultra-2-gps-cellular-49mm-titanium-case-with-blue-ocean-band-titanium%2F6560063.p%3FskuId%3D6560063&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) model next week, it may be worth it to check your list twice and check your cart out now if you haven't already. Because starting this Thursday, Dec. 21, you won't be able to purchase the Apple Watch Ultra 2 or the Apple Watch Series 9 -- at least not directly from Apple.

The sudden freeze in sales is a result of an October ruling from the International Trade Commission (ITC) regarding the Apple Watch's blood oxygen sensor following a legal dispute between Apple and medical technology company Masimo.

While the injunction from the ITC only applies to Apple selling the devices (the products are still going to be available from other retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and more), it's vital to note that the ban also stops Apple from _importing_ the watches, too. This means Apple can't send more devices to retailers that are selling them, and the product that's on those stores' shelves currently is what's available in the US market until further notice.

**Also:** [**Why I suddenly rushed to buy an Apple Watch from Amazon (that I didn't really want to buy)**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-i-suddenly-rushed-to-buy-an-apple-watch-from-amazon-that-i-didnt-really-want-to-buy/)

So, what does that mean for you? Well, there will likely be a shortage of Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches across major retailers that no amount of Santa's elves can remedy. The good news is that if you want one of Apple's latest wearables, there's still time to buy, and ZDNET has rounded up the best Series 9 and Ultra 2 watch deals that are live, as well as where you can find them.
