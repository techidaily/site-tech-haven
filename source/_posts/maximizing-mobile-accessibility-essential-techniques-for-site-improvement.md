[New Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/12/2020 6:38:07 PM 

 I have used Epubor from almost the start and have had no problems at all in converting and transferring books to my Kobo. Now I have bought my first Kindle, an Oasis version 10.  
 I converted my ebooks that I have on Epubor Ultimate to mobi. When I tried a trial run moving 1 mobi book to the Kindle, I cannot find it on the Kindle. When I tried to move it again to the kindle, the pop up menu said it was already on the kindle. I still cannot find it.  
 Any ideas?

[OEB converter?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/8/2021 5:48:11 AM 

Extracted an ebook hoopla file from my phone SD card, which appears to be an OEB file. Trying to get the file into suitable format for Kindle (awz, epub, mobi, etc). The Kindle is not a Fire. Highlighting the files to open in Calibre tries to create 76 separate books! Online forums in past suggested trying Sigil or MobiCreator (which I don't have). Any way in Epubor Ultimate???

[convert to .mobi fails](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/16/2021 2:22:06 AM

[move Mobi books to kindle oasis 10th edition](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/17/2020 10:09:36 PM 

hello, I hope you are safe and well.  
 I have just bought a Kindle Oasis 10th edition ereader to use along with my Kobo Forma ereader. My Kindle app on my computer is set to the older edition that Epubor recommends and can remove DRM, convert the books to epub and then move them to my Kobo Forma easily.Using EPubor, I have converted all my Kobo books to a MOBI format but I am having problems transferring these MOBI format ebooks to my Kindle Oasis. When I try bulk transfer (say 50 books out of 950 books) some books go to the downloads folder and some go to other folders altogether. What is the easiest way to move these MOBI format books from my computer to my Kindle Oasis and have them all in the correct download folder?  
 Many thanks for your help. Please stay safe and well. 

[Duplicate chapters in Mobi conversion](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/19/2020 1:43:30 AM 

Is anybody else having the issue where there are multiple copies of each chapter in a Mobi conversion of a Kindle book? After decrypting each Kindle book, I convert it to a Mobi file and then upload that Mobi file to calibre. Upon reading, I see at least three copies of the same chapter before I can access the next chapter, OR after reading a few chapters, I then get a repeat of those same three chapters. It's maddening!

[Why mobi books don't show cover](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/25/2018 3:55:21 PM

[How to convert decrypted files to MOBI](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 10/20/2020 3:17:46 AM 

I've downloaded the free trial software and have decrypted an ePub file. I know it only decrpts 20% of the book, and I can preview it on a webpage.

 How do I convert it to MOBI so I can load it on my Kindle and view how the software works?

 I'm not adverse to purchasing the full version, but I'd like to see how it works first. 

 Would greatly appreciate some feedback.

[Epubor Ultimate metadata issue](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 4/4/2023 9:15:56 AM 

When converting epub to mobi or even azw3 or anything else, the date in the metadata SHOULD not change as that is the published date. However, I have been having non-stop issues with Epubor Ultimate whenever I have tried to convert a book from epub to mobi or something else. It will CHANGE the date in the metadata from the original published data listed which is accurate, to the current date, which is the day I am converting the file. I don't want to have to continually go through and fix every single file so they are accurate. Can you PLEASE fix this so they are indeed accurate to the book???
