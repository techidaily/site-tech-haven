### Key Takeaways

* Sam Altman has been fired by OpenAI due to concerns about his communication and transparency with the board, potentially impacting the company's development.
* Mira Murati, the company's CTO, will serve as interim CEO, but OpenAI may seek a new CEO from the tech industry to lead future product development.
* The firing of Altman has left uncertainties about the future of OpenAI's development, particularly the progress of ChatGPT and the potential successor to GPT-4.

Sam Altman has been fired by OpenAI with immediate effect.

 In a prepared statement released by OpenAI on Friday, 17, 2023, it was revealed that Altman would no longer lead the company's AI development, during which time he has overseen the enormously successful launches of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, powering ChatGPT.

It's a shock move, but why has the OpenAI board axed Altman now?

## Why Has OpenAI Fired CEO Sam Altman?

[OpenAI's official statement](https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition) confirms that Sam Altman's departure comes after a "deliberate review process by the board," indicating that Altman's behavior and responsibilities at the company were under question. It appears that during the review, the OpenAI board found that Altman had kept information from them, which made it difficult for the board to carry out its responsibilities.

> Mr. Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.

 OpenAI was structured to enable the company to progress with its overall mission of developing[artificial general intelligence](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence-how-it-differs-generative-ai/) —that is, artificial intelligence that can perform effectively any task without issue.

 Whatever Altman did or held back in his communication with the OpenAI board, it was enough to see him immediately removed from the post, potentially drastically altering the course of development for one of the world's most important startups.

## Who Is Replacing Sam Altman as OpenAI CEO?

 As part of the same statement, OpenAI revealed that Mira Murati, the company's chief technology officer, will serve as interim CEO, with the changes taking effect immediately.

 Murati has been part of the OpenAI leadership team for five years, and it's understood that OpenAI values her existing engagement throughout the company.

 However, as Murati's appointment is temporary, OpenAI may well turn to the wider tech world to find a new CEO to lead the development of its primary product, ChatGPT, and the suspected development of GPT-5, the successor to GPT-4.

## What's Next for OpenAI? Will This Affect ChatGPT?

 It appears OpenAI is undergoing a restructuring, starting from the very top. The company's statement alludes strongly to issues in communication and trust between the two parties; apparently, that trust cannot be rebuilt, and therefore, Altman is gone.

 How this affects OpenAI's development of ChatGPT remains to be seen. It's enormously surprising given the prominence of Altman at OpenAI's November 2023 Dev Day, where custom GPTs and GPT-4 Turbo were revealed.

 Of course, Altman alone is not responsible for the development of ChatGPT. But given his stature within OpenAI and the wider artificial intelligence world as a whole, the shockwaves of Altman's firing will be keenly felt.
