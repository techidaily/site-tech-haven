![AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/ccd6eaa3e23201b442e925b69c7ad6bee804c2ac/2024/09/09/1c2435ae-50e2-4bda-8b1a-2bb5e3267583/img-0038.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

If you were looking to upgrade your second or third-generation AirPods, you're in luck. During the iPhone 16 event where Apple unveiled new Apple Watches and [iPhones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-compared-which-new-iphone-should-you-buy/), the company also announced two [new fourth-generation AirPods](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airpods%2Fairpods-4&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) on Sept. 9.

**Also: [Everything Apple announced at iPhone 16 event: AirPods, Apple Watch Series 10, AI, more](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-announced-at-iphone-16-event-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-ai-more/)**

Both AirPods in the fourth-generation lineup debut with Apple's H2 audio chip, the same one found in the AirPods Pro 2\. This audio chip ensures enhanced audio quality, noise cancellation, audio processing, microphone quality, and better integration with Siri. 

Neither AirPods 4 option features the silicon ear tips found on the Pro 2, but if you prefer the open-ear fit of the second or third-generation AirPods, you'll enjoy the AirPods 4's fit. Additionally, both AirPods 4 models have force sensors on the earbud stem, meaning a series of short and long presses on the stem completes audio commands like play, pause, track skip, and more.

**Also: [How iPhone 16 Pro's Audio Mix provides studio quality sound](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-iphone-16-pros-audio-mix-provides-studio-quality-sound/)**

These AirPods can be separated into entry-level and mid-tier categories, with the mid-tier AirPods 4 offering more premium features than the entry-level AirPods 4\. Of course, the entry-level AirPods are cheaper. There are other differences between the two AirPods to consider before you preorder or purchase the earbuds, so let's go over them to help you make the most informed decision.

## 1\. You love your AirPods (2nd generation) but want some upgrades

If you like the simplicity of the second-generation AirPods but think it's time for an upgrade, the entry-level AirPods 4 are for you. Like the second-generation AirPods, the [entry-level AirPods 4](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airpods%2Fairpods-4&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) don't have active noise cancellation or Transparency Mode. However, they debut with spatial audio, making music, movie-watching, and mobile gaming more immersive.

**Also: [I used my iPhone 15 Pro without a case for a year. Here's how it looks today](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-used-my-iphone-15-pro-without-a-case-for-a-year-heres-how-it-looks-today/)**

Regarding upgrades, the AirPods 4's charging case delivers six more hours of battery life than the second-generation AirPods. Additionally, the AirPods 4's charging case supports USB-C charging and has an IP54 dust and water resistance rating. 

## 2\. You want the most affordable option

The entry-level AirPods are cheaper than the AirPods 4 mid-tier model and the AirPods Pro 2\. You can still purchase the second and third-generation AirPods from Apple, but they don't have the same upgraded features as the new AirPods 4.

### 1\. The AirPods Pro 2 have too many features you'll never use

The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple's most advanced earbuds, offering an array of audio features and auditory health options. These features include Siri Interactions and Voice Isolation, a clinically validated hearing test, and hearing aid mode. If these features don't excite you, and you don't want to pay for software you'll never use, the mid-tier AirPods 4 are the best option for you.

**Also: [Your AirPods Pro 2 can soon double as over-the-counter hearing aids. Here's how](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-airpods-pro-2-can-soon-double-as-over-the-counter-hearing-aids-heres-how/)**

The AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation have noise-canceling and transparency modes, spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and an IP54 water and dust resistance rating. The charging case is USB-C and wireless charging compatible. However, the mid-tier AirPods 4 have one less hours of continuous playback than the AirPods 3.

### 2\. You want the "just right" AirPods

If you're upgrading from the AirPods 3, you'll enjoy the fact that the mid-tier AirPods 4 have more audio features and some hardware upgrades. The AirPods 3 don't have noise cancellation or conversation awareness, a feature that quiets your music when the earbuds' microphones pick up on you trying to have a conversation. Additionally, the mid-tier AirPods 4's case has better water and dust resistance and wireless charging compatibility.

**Also: [Buying an Apple Watch Series 10? Consider these 3 features before you pre-order](https://www.zdnet.com/article/buying-an-apple-watch-series-10-consider-these-3-features-before-you-pre-order/)**

You can think of the AirPods 4 with noise cancellation as the "Goldilocks" AirPods since they give users the best of both worlds. You get upgraded audio features not found in the second or third-generation AirPods without offering too many advanced features found in the AirPods Pro 2.
