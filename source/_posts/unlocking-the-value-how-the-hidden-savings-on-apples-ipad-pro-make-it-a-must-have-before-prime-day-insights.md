## Unlocking the Secret: How the Exclusive Pre-Prime Day Offer on Apple's iPad Pro Outshines Competitors - Insights

Apple rarely discounts its latest products, let alone ones that only launched -- _checks calendar_ \-- a little more than a month ago. Sometimes, however, when the stars align and the moon passes [between the Earth and the sun](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-captured-the-2024-solar-eclipse-from-first-contact-to-totality-here-are-the-photos/), you _can_ buy the newest Apple product for less than retail. That's the case with the [M4 iPad Pro](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Landscape%2Fdp%2FB0D3J9XDMQ%3Fth%3D1%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C928c76e0-7991-4296-835f-5fc747ca6ed4%7Cdtp&dtb=1), which can be had on Amazon for up to $100 off at the time of writing.

**Also: [The 60 best 4th of July sales of 2024: TVs, laptops, Apple products, and more](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-4th-of-july-sales-2024-07-03/)**

Specifically, the 11-inch variant is $70 off, and the 13-inch is $100 off across various storage configurations. Those aren't steep price drops per se, but they're helpful discounts on products we've tested and highly recommend.

The latest iPad Pro model offers several external and internal improvements. As far as hardware goes, the new iPads are thinner and lighter than ever -- more so than the Air model. That makes them more portable, less tiring to hold when you're watching shows in bed, and a little less painful when you eventually drop one on your face. Just me? I've been testing one since launch day, and it still blows me away how thin this tablet is.

Apple also made the smart choice of moving the front-facing camera to the longer side of the iPad, which means that when you use it in landscape orientation -- which you'll probably be doing 95% of the time -- you're positioned more naturally during video calls.

An OLED display means you'll get better contrasts and darker blacks from the iPad Pro.

Internally, the new iPad Pro features Apple's most powerful Silicon yet, the M4, besting the M3 on MacBooks. What a time to be alive, eh? That lends the tablet improved multitasking performance, improved efficiency when running AI-related tasks, and a significantly brighter display. Thanks to a Tandem OLED display -- the stacking of two OLED panels to boost brightness -- the 2024 iPad Pro is better to look at and work with, especially for creative tasks.

Right now, Amazon has both the [11- and 13-inch options on sale for $928 and $1,198](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J6L2ZC%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C928c76e0-7991-4296-835f-5fc747ca6ed4%7Cdtp&dtb=1), respectively. Again, you'll only be saving between $80 to $100, but the discount can be offloaded towards [additional accessories](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dipad%2Bpro%2B2024%2Baccessories%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C928c76e0-7991-4296-835f-5fc747ca6ed4%7Cdtp&dtb=1).
