## **How to Get Help Using Windows 10 Contact Support app**

 Follow these steps to open and use Contact Support  
  
 1\. Type “Contact Support” in the search box at the bottom right corner of the desktop. Then click**Contact Support** in the pop-up menu.

 2\. Type the issue that you have in the box then click**Next** button. For me, I want to know how to open Device Manager, so I type “how to open device manager”.
