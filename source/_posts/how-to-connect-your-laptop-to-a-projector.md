## Try these fixes

 Before trying the fixes below, simply**reboot the Air Link** in your Oculus software as well as your headset, and make sure your PC meets theminimum compatibility requirements for Oculus Link.

1. **[Relaunch Oculus software with Task Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Adjust your devices’ Wi-Fi channel](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update device drivers of your PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. [**Update your Operating System**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. **[Close conflicting programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Check for Oculus Debug Tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
7. **[Factory reset your Quest](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 You may not need to try all the above fixes; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

## Fix 1: Relaunch Oculus software with Task Manager

 When your Oculus Air Link is not working, one easy way that may solve it is to end the Oculus software and its related process completely by the Windows in-built program Task Manager and later open the Oculus software again to see if the Air Link shows up and works.

1. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** keys to open the Task Manager.
2. Under the Processes tab, right-click the three**Oculus processes** and select**End task** from the pop-up menus.

3. Restart your Oculus software and check if the Air Link functions properly.

 If this method doesn’t work for you, try the following below.  

## Fix 2: Adjust your devices’ Wi-Fi channel

 Air Link’s performance might be impacted if the network connection environment isn’t ideal for it. When a Wi-Fi channel is used by too many devices, it could cause many problems including Air Link lagging or even not responding at all. To avoid this, you’d better use a modern router that comes with**dual-band connections (2.4GHz and 5GHz)** and arrange your network setup like this:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AIR-LINK-networks-setup.jpg)

* Clear other devices in the 5 GHz band and set it only for your headset for optimal Air Link performance.
* Have the 2.4GHz band for other home devices such as phones, printers, and monitors.
* Use an ethernet cable to connect your PC or laptop to your router.
* Make sure that your router isn’t far away from your headset. Placing them within the same room is the best.

 If your Air Link setup has already gone through the above practices but the problem is still there, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Update device drivers of your PC

 This issue might also occur when you’re using outdated or faulty device drivers, especially the**GPU driver and USB driver** . Updated drivers can keep your accessories working flawlessly and smoothly with your operating systems and applications.

## Fix 4: Update your Operating System

 In addition to updating your device drivers, you should consider upgrading the Windows operating system. Since Microsoft keeps releasing OS updates with bug fixes for applications and processes, it may resolve some conflicts with the Oculus Air Link. Here’s how you can check for updates:

#### On Windows 10

1. Type **check for updates** in the search box, and select it from the results.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/type-check-for-updates.jpg)
2. Click **Check for updates** and wait for the checking.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/check-for-updates.jpg)
3. The checking result could be**You’re up to date** , which means you don’t need to do anything else.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If not, a **Download and install** button will appear. Click on it to initiate a Windows update.

#### On Windows 11

1. Press the **Windows + I** keys to open Settings, and then click **Windows Update**  on the left panel.

## Fix 5: Close conflicting programs

 Two programs can conflict with each other when they run on the same computer at the same time due to some programming bugs and manifests. In this case, problems could occur, causing the Oculus software to run wrong and thus affect the Air Link. Here’s a list of**programs that might conflict with Oculus software** according to reports online.

| Asus GameFirst V                            |
| ------------------------------------------- |
| Geforce Experience                          |
| Lenovo Nerve Sense                          |
| Lenovo Vantage                              |
| McAfee, Avast / AVG / ESET Norton antivirus |
| MSI Afterburner                             |
| NordVPN, Bitdefender VPN, PIA, Proton VPN   |
| Razer Cortex                                |
| Riots Vanguard                              |
| Steam VR                                    |
| TeamViewer application                      |
| WebRoot, MalwareBytes                       |
| Windows Xbox Game Bar                       |

 If your Oculus Air Link is crashing while one of the above programs is running, try **closing the program as well as its background running process and then rebooting the Air Link** .

If this trick doesn’t give you luck, try the next one.

## Fix 6: Check for Oculus Debug Tools

 The Oculus Debug Tool (ODT) packed in the Oculus install file is an advanced tool that enables you to check and configure your game’s performance or debugging settings. So when things go wrong with Oculus software or Air Link, you could simply check on the ODT to see whether some of the settings aren’t right. Here’s how:

1. Press**Windows + E** keys to open the File Explorer. Copy and paste the following path into the address bar, then hit Enter.  
**C:\\Program Files\\Oculus\\Support\\oculus-diagnostics**
2. Double-click the**OculusDebug Tool** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Oculus-Debug-Tool-1.jpg)
3. Under the category Oculus Link, check if the**Enode Dynamic Bitrate Enode** is in “Default” status. If not, click on the option and select**Default** from the drop-down menu.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Go on to check if the parameter of**Encode Bitrate (Mbps)** is “0”. If not, change it to**0** .

## Fix 7: Factory reset your Quest

 This is the solution you should try last when you somehow run into issues with your Quest and the Air Link. It may clear out the errors in your headset and the Oculus software but the shortcoming is that the factory reset will wipe all your game data off. So please proceed at your own peril.  
 Here’s how to perform a factory reset using the headset:

1. Press and hold the**power** and**volume** buttons until it turns on.
2. Highlight**Factory reset** , then press the power button to select it.
3. Select**Yes, erase and factory reset** , then press the power button to initiate the reset.
