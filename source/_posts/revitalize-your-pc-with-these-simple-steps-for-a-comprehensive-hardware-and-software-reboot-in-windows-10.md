 The next screen presents you with the choice between a local reinstall and a cloud download. Local reinstall uses existing assets on your PC to rebuild a clean copy of Windows, while cloud download fetches a new copy of Windows 10 from Microsoft. You can use whichever you prefer, just keep in mind that the cloud install will use about four gigabytes of data. That could be important if you're on a metered network or have slow Internet.

![Select 'Cloud Download' or 'Local Reinstall.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/5-cloud-dl-or-local.jpg) 

 In the next window, you'll see a message showing you what will happen when you reset your computer. This message will be different, depending on which method you chose in the previous step.

 When you're ready, select the "Reset" button.
