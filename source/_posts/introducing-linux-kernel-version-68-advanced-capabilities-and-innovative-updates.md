## Introducing Linux Kernel Version 6.8: Advanced Capabilities and Innovative Updates

Today marks the release of [Linux kernel 6.8](https://kernel.org). This is a relatively "normal" release when compared to last year's Linux kernel 6.7, though it includes several future-forward improvements and bug fixes. Naturally, the merge window for Linux kernel 6.9 will open shortly after this 6.8 release.

 Linux creator Linus Torvalds announced the 6.8 release in a [Linux Kernel Mailing List](https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/3/10/243) message. As Linus notes, the "biggest single new thing" in Linux kernel 6.8 is probably the new Intel Xe DRM driver. This driver is currently disabled by default but provides support for the Intel Xe GPU architecture. It should deliver improved graphics performance on PCs that use Intel Core 11th, 12th and 13th Gen processors or Intel Arc GPUs.

 The 6.8 release adds support for "boost" speeds on Intel Core Ultra processors. If you load Linux on a laptop like the [ThinkPad X1 Carbon (12th Gen)](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-transforming-live-dialogues-into-permanent-history/), you should receive the same performance as you would on Windows.

 Tux is also giving the Raspberry Pi platform some love, as Linux kernel 6.8 adds Pi 5 support to the V3D DRM driver. This should resolve the Pi 5's graphics incompatibility in some distros. And, interestingly, this release adds [RFI mitigation](https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/wbrf.html) for AMD 7000-series processors.

 For gamers, the 6.8 release enables new color management features on the Steam Deck and provides expanded connectivity for wireless gamepads. Some of the gamepads that are now supported include Nintedo's Switch Online collection (the retro SNES and N64 controllers, for instance) and Lenovo Legion Go controllers.

 Other changes in this release are subtle, niche, or intended for future technologies. Linux kernel 6.8 introduces Rust kernel support for LoongArch CPUs, support for Btrfs’s fscrypt implementation, and compatibility with Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). It introduces a deadline servers scheduling feature, plus support for DAMON memory-management auto-tuning.

 You can [download Linux kernel 6.8](https://kernel.org) today. Some Linux distributions should begin using this kernel within the coming days or weeks, while others may hold off until the next major distro update to prevent bugs. Just know that 6.8 is a short-lived release. Linux Torvalds plans to unleash Linux kernel 6.9 in May 2024—just two months from now.
