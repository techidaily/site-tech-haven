## How to Check RAM on Windows | Quickly & Easily

Want to check the RAM on your Windows 10 computer or laptop? You’ve come to the right place. This post will show you several methods to**check RAM on Windows 10** .

## What is RAM?

 RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It’s a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly. RAM stores various types of information about running programs in your computer. However, RAM can only stores the data as long as the computer is on, so if the computer shuts down, it will lose the previously stored data.

 There are two main types of RAM in the current market: DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) and SRAM (Static Random Access Memory). Generally speaking, the more RAM your computer is, the faster it can run. If your computer is running slow to a crawl, one of the main causes can be the small RAM capacity that influences the system performance.

## How to check how much RAM you have
