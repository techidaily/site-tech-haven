What is EPUB? I believe every ebook lover is very familiar with EPUB, but not each of you knows what EPUB stands for. EPUB is short for electronic publication. When a book with the extension .epub, it can be read and downloaded in devices like smartphones, tablets, computers, or e-reader. As the publishing standard for ebooks, EPUB format is applied to most of the ebooks, except for Kindle books which are using its own exlcusive format like mobi, Azw3, KFX, or azw formats.

However, if you want to read a EPUB format file on your PC, you may have difficulties from Windows not being able to recognize the format. Today, I am going to introduce two methods on readiing EPUB on PC. They are all easy-to-use and totally free. 

* [(2 Methods) Read epub on PC via Browsers](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [(5 Methods) Read epub on PC via ebook Reader App Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Things Need to Do before Reading Epub on PC

If you have purchased epub books from the main stream ebook vendors, like Google Play or Kobo, they will be encrypted with DRM scheme. That means you can only open these epub files with specified Apps,let's say Adobe Digital Editons. Besides ADE, we have many other reading options. If you want to read epub on other apps, please [remove DRM from epub](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) at first to ensure your EPUB files are DRM free. 

### Read EPUB on PC via Browsers

For people who are in favor of browers, I will recommend 2 browers-Google Chrome and Firefox. What you have to do is installing one browser plugin to your browser. Just one step, your browser will become your epub reader App online.

#### 1\. MagicScroll Web Reader for reading epub on PC

 If you happen to be an user of Google Chrome, you can use it as your ebook reader. Anyway, if you have not installed a Google Chrome, you can take his opportunity to have a try.

**Step 1: Install Google Chrome and add the MagicScroll Web Reader**

You have to download and install the Google Chrome before adding the MagicScroll web Reader. Then go to the [MagicScroll](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/magicscroll%20web%20reader) extension page and click on "Add to Chrome" button to install. It will be succeed in installing in your Chrome. 

**Step 2: Read EPUB File on PC**

Once the MagicScroll Web Reader has been installed, you can open a new tab with the [home page of MagicScroll](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/magicscroll-web-reader/ecldhagehndokdmaiaigoaecbmbnmfkc?hl=en).  
 You can add your book to your library by clicking “add a book to your library”. Then it will give you two options to input your ebook: PC or ebook source from the internet. Once added, all ebooks will be accessible from your library. You can read your epub book by using this library.

With 4 menu buttons available at the top left corner of each book page, you can go the library main page, table of contents, options to change font size and theme colors as well as option to download the ebook locally onto your computer. 

Once your books have been added to the library, you are available to access them from any other platform. This is very convenient for book reading and makes you feel like you are reading on an e-reader.

#### 2\. EPUBReader for reading epub on PC via Firefox

If you are not a fan of Google Chrome, but there is an alternative for it –Firefox.

**Step 1: Add EPUBReader to Firefox** 

Go to [EPUBReader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/epubreader/) extension page, click on the “Add to Firefox” to finish the installation.

**Step 2: Read EPUB BOOK** 

After the installation, an additional icon will show at the top right of your Firefox browser. You can launch EPUBReader by clicking it. In the reader page, you will find lots of ebook collections that are available from archive.org and Gutenberg.org for free.

Also, you can drag the EPUB books you want to read to the Firefox browser window or just download the EPUB file by clicking the download link. EPUBReader created a page where all the EPUB files, you downloaded/opened, are listed. 

![Firefox](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Firefox310.png)

Changing reading style, increasing/decreasing font size, and setting bookmarks are all available in EPUBReader.

These extensions are designed as minimalist EPUB ebook readers that enable you to browse through ebooks directly from these two browsers. Without installing an additional EPUB reading app on your computer, you can smoothly read EPUB books on a Windows computer using only your web browser with certain EPUB reader extensions. However, if you're seeking an ebook reader with multiple features, it's advisable to consider using an EPUB reading app for Windows rather than relying solely on browser extensions.

### Summary

Indeed, the tools I mentioned are just a selection among many available options. Other notable free EPUB readers include Nook for PC/Mac, Kobo for PC/Mac, and several others. Choosing the best one for you depends on your specific reading preferences and habits. Explore these options to find the one that best suits your needs and enhances your reading experience. 

All the above-mentioned EPUB readers only support DRM-free EPUB files, except for Adobe Digital Editions, which supports Adobe DRM-protected EPUB and PDF formats. Considering that most purchased ebooks are protected by DRM, the majority of ebook readers cannot handle this type of EPUB book, except for ADE. If you're not a fan of ADE, how can you solve this problem? Please just try out the free EPUB DRM Removal tool--[Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/).
