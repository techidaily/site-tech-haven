I like Epubor Audible Converter, but it will be better if it can split the entire audiobook into chapters after conversion.

If you also want to find a Audials Tunebite Platinum Universal Converter alternative no matter for what reason, you should try Avdshare Video Converter.

I'm a big fan of inaudible. Yes I have to run it on my 1 windows computer but it does a great job and really isn't all that confusing once you get the hang of it. What I also like, besides it being able to convert my audible audiobooks, is that I can point it at huge single m4b files and it can break them apart into multiple mp3 files by chapter, just like it would an audible book. Often times I'm given an audiobook in m4b format but my audio player is not a big fan of that format, often times when I pause and then close the program and go to open it again, it brings me back to the beginning of the book! I love being able to split m4b files into mp3's just like all my other audiobooks. Consistency is nice. Also I like that it auto matches the output bitrate to the source bitrate, there's no need to have 256kbps output on a 64kbps input, and no reason to downsample a 128kbps input to 64kbps output, etc.

Are you ever going to add a method to split the audiobook into chapters. The biggest problem I have is that the players that I have tried do not keep my last place. I am talking about players that work in my Galaxy Watch 4.

Thank you for using our software. Epubor Audible converter enables you to split audible into chapters. Please ensure you are using the licensed version because the this feature is not available in the trial version.
