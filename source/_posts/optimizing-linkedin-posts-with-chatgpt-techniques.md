## ChatGPT Sign-In Glitches? Find Relief with These Proven Techniques

 ChatGPT is great until you cannot log in—no access to your ChatGPT history and no access to the generative AI's wealth of knowledge.

However, all is not lost. Here's how you fix the ChatGPT login error.

## Common ChatGPT Login Errors

![ChatGPT is at capacity error](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chatgpt-is-at-capacity-right-now.jpg)

 The most common ChatGPT login issue users face is "ChatGPT is at capacity right now," which occurs when a large number of users are simultaneously trying to access the platform.

 Some users report another ChatGPT login error where they are stuck in a login loop. The user enters their login credentials on the ChatGPT login page and clicks the Login button but is repeatedly redirected to the same login page. This can occur due to a problem with the authentication process where the server fails to recognize the user's credentials. It can also be a browser cache problem, which can be resolved by clearing the cache and cookies—more on this below.

 Unfortunately, there is no single way to fix the ChatGPT login error, but we've listed some of the best options to try.

## 1\. Wait It Out

 If you encounter the ChatGPT maximum capacity issue, waiting it out is a decent option. The server load is likely to decrease after some time, allowing you to access ChatGPT normally again.

 Such issues typically take around 15–20 minutes to resolve, after which you should be able to access ChatGPT without trying out any technical solutions. Additionally, you can also click on the**Get notified when we are back** button to receive an email when ChatGPT is back up and running.

## 2\. Check the Status of the ChatGPT Server

 Checking the status of the GPT server can also help determine whether the issue is at ChatGPT's end.

 If the server is down or experiencing any other issues, you won't be able to log into the platform successfully. In this case, you are pretty much left with no choice but to wait for the servers to come back online. To find out if there are any server issues or downtime updates, you can visit the[ChatGPT Server Status](https://status.openai.com/) page.

## 3\. Check Your Internet Connection

![ChatGPT timeout error](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gpt-timeout.jpg)

You must have a stable internet connection to use ChatGPT.

 When you attempt to log into the platform, the login page sends your credentials to the server. If your internet connection is weak, the transmission is delayed, leading to slow loading times, login errors, and page timeouts.

 Try reconnecting to your internet connection, switching to another network, or restarting your router to see if that helps.

## 4\. Disable Your VPN

 When using a VPN, your internet connection routes through a different server and network. This can cause issues while accessing certain websites and services.

 For example, ChatGPT may have blocked the VPN provider you are using, or the VPN may be causing delays or lagging, leading to the problem. The best way to move forward is to disable your VPN and use your regular internet connection to access ChatGPT.

 If you prefer using a VPN, you can also try switching to a better alternative to avoid such issues in the future. Here are some of[the best free VPN options for your PC](http://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-the-best-free-vpn-for-pc/) .

## 5\. Clear the Browser Cache

 Problems with your browser's cache data may prevent you from accessing ChatGPT successfully. This is the data your browser stores when you visit a website and can include small files, cookies, and other similar information. If it becomes corrupt or outdated, it can cause issues like slow load times and errors when accessing certain platforms.

 You can clear your browser's cache data in an attempt to fix the ChatGPT login error. Since this data is temporary, clearing it won't damage your essential files.

Follow these steps to clear the cache in Chrome:

1. In Chrome, click on the three dots in the top-right corner.
2. Choose**More tools** \>**Clear browsing data** .  
![Choose the Clear browsing data option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/clear-browsing-date.jpg)
3. In the following dialog, choose what to do you want to delete and click on the**Clear data** button. We recommend check-marking all the options to eliminate the issue.

 Wait for the process to complete, then check if the issue is resolved. The process is similar on all popular browsers.

## 6\. Subscribe to ChatGPT Plus
