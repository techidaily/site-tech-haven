```` `` The first quick and easy method to solve the problem is to disable Fast Startup on your Windows 10 device.

## Method 3: Update your graphics card driver

 If there are any old or corrupted drivers on your Windows 10 PC, this can cause your computer to boot slowly. You can update your device drivers to solve your problem.

```` ``

```` `` You can do this manually by downloading the latest drivers  from your graphics card manufacturer’s official website. You’ll need to find exactly the correct driver, though.  If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually,  or if you want to save some time, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to do it automatically.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. Your sound driver is no exception.

3) C  lick **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
