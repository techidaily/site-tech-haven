## Best Extensions: Save and Distribute Your Interactions on ChatGPT

 ChatGPT is a phenomenally powerful tool that has led the way in the rise of generative AI chatbots. However, exporting or saving your ChatGPT conversations in a useful format is not easy. Luckily, there are browser extensions to help you to achieve this easily and quickly.

 Let's look at some of the best apps and extensions to help you get the most from ChatGPT.

## 1\. ShareGPT

 ShareGPT is a browser extension that can be added to the most popular web browsers, including Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. The premise of the extension is to allow easy sharing of ChatGPT chats with a single click.

 It does this by creating a custom URL for each chat you wish to share. You create the URL by selecting the**Share** button that is added to the ChatGPT interface:

![Screenshot of ShareGPT Share Screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-sharegpt-share-screen.jpg)

 Clicking this button opens up a new tab with a custom URL containing a complete export chat record. This can then be shared with whoever you need.

![Screenshot of ShareGPT URL](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-sharegpt-url.jpg)

 Overall, we found this to be simple but effective. If you want a no-frills and easy-to-use way of sharing your ChatGPT conversations, this ticks all the boxes.

 Although this is a Google Chrome extension, it also installs on Microsoft Edge. The installation was quick and simple. We installed it on both Edge and Chrome without any problems.

**Download** :[ShareGPT](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sharegpt-share-your-chatg/daiacboceoaocpibfodeljbdfacokfjb) (Free)

## 2\. Export ChatGPT Conversation

 There is a[lot of hype surrounding Notion](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-everyone-using-notion/) , the productivity and note-taking app. So, it is no surprise that there is a ChatGPT extension that can export your conversations directly into Notion.

 One neat feature is that the app tidies up the formatting of your conversation before saving it into your Notion workspace. This app isn't just for Notion users, though—there are also options to download your chats as images or to copy them to your clipboard.

 We tested its ability to directly export chats into Notion using the conversation below.

![Screenshot of ChatGPT conversation for Notion](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-chatgpt-conversation-for-notion.jpg)

 Once the chat is ready to export, you can access Export ChatGPT from the extensions drop-down from your browser (usually located to the right of the address bar). This brings up the dialog box shown below.

![Screenshot of Export ChatGPT dialog box](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-export-chatgpt-dialog-box.jpg)

 You will need to link your Notion account to the app, but this was easy. We found that the process was automatic if you had your Notion account open on the same browser.

 Overall, if you are a Notion user, this delivers on all its promises. If you aren't a Notion user, there are probably better options. However, again it was simple to install on Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.

## 3\. ChatGPT Export and Share

 This extension works with Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. However, the installation isn't available through the proprietary extension sources for the browsers in question. That said, it is a nice tool once installed and worth a little effort.

[Installing an extension manually on Chrome](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually/) or another browser isn't that difficult. The steps to do this are detailed below.

### Installing ChatGPT Export and Share for Chrome and Edge

1. Download the appropriate version from the[ChatGPT Export and Share download page](https://github.com/liady/ChatGPT-pdf/releases/tag/1.3.4) .
2. Extract the zipped files to a folder on your computer. For example, here's[how you extract files on Windows 10](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/) .
3. Open the browser you want to add the extension to and navigate to the extensions page. This can be done by clicking the**Extensions** icon and selecting**Manage Extensions** or typing the following into the address bar—**chrome://extensions** or**edge://extensions** .
4. Enable developer mode by switching the appropriate toggle switch. The picture below shows this in Microsoft Edge; Chrome users will find it at the top right of the page.  
![Screenshot of Edge Extensions Page ](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-edge-extensions-page.jpg)
5. Install the extension by clicking the**Load unpacked** button and selecting the folder where you extracted the files. ChatGPT Export and Share should now be activated.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Installing ChatGPT Export and Share on Firefox

 The first two steps are identical for Firefox, with the obvious exception that you select the Firefox version. After ChatGPT Export and Share is downloaded and extracted, the following steps will install it in Firefox.

1. Type**about:debugging** into the Firefox address bar.
2. Click**This Firefox** and then click**Load Temporary Add-on** .  
![Screenshot of ChatGPT Export and Share Firefox Installation](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-chatgpt-export-and-share-firefox-installation.jpg)
3. Select the**content\_script.js** from the extracted installer.

4. You should now have access to the extension on the ChatGPT website.

 The unfortunate thing for Firefox users is that this extension will only be active as long as you keep Firefox open. If you close your browser, you must repeat the above steps each time you start Firefox. Not ideal!

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Apart from that, this simple tool allows you to export your ChatGPT conversations as a PDF, weblink, or PNG file. Simple to use, with no bells and whistles, but there are easier-to-install tools that do the same function.

**Download** :[ChatGPT Export and Share](https://github.com/liady/ChatGPT-pdf/releases/tag/1.3.4) (Free)

## 4\. ChatGPT Prompt Genius

 If you are looking for an extension that does much more than just allow you to export your chats, then ChatGPT Prompt Genius might be right up your street. Among the nifty features that this extension includes is added functionality to the prompting process. There are plenty of[extensions that can add useful functionality to ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-chrome-extensions-better-ai-prompts-answers-in-browsers/) .

 However, this article will concentrate on its export and share features.

 For exporting chats, the extension adds a**Share & Export** option to the ChatGPT sidebar. This allows you to select how you want to share your conversation. The options are:

* PDF
* PNG
* Markdown file
* Shared link

 The image below shows how these options can be selected when exporting your chat.

![Screenshot ChatGPT Prompt Genius](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-chatgpt-prompt-genius.jpg)

<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901410&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg" border="0"> vMix Pro - Software based live production. vMix Pro includes everything in vMix 4K plus 8 channels of Replay and 8 vMix Call 
This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a>

 We liked the inclusion of Markdown language with this tool, which is very convenient if you are using text for web content. We tested each option, and they all worked perfectly with the link option, creating a unique, easily shared URL.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Overall, this tool was easy to install and worked exactly as intended. If you want to easily share your work and[improve your prompting techniques](https://www.makeuseof.com/prompting-techniques-to-improve-chatgpt-responses/) at the same time, ChatGPT Prompt Genius might be the tool for you.

## Simplifying Sharing Your ChatGPT Conversations

 For something that began almost as a curiosity, AI-generative chatbots have rapidly become an important and powerful tool. As their usage continues to rise exponentially, the need to easily export and share conversations will become increasingly critical.

 The tools we covered here could be considered "early adopters" of a trend that can only go upwards. In the future, we can expect more functionality and features to become available as developers rush to take advantage of this burgeoning technology.
