### Is it cross-platform?

 The answer to this question is both “Yes” and “No”. If you’re a Android player, you can join a squad that has iOS players, and vice versa. But you cannot join the match with Steam players or Xbox One players.

### What’s the minimum system requirements?

#### For the iOS players

* Requires**iOS 9.0** or later.
* Compatible with**iPhone 5s** or later,**iPad Air** or later, and**iPod touch (6th generation)** .
* Requires a stable internet connection.

#### For Android players

* Requires Android 5.1.1 or above.
* At least**2 GB** memory.
* Requires a stable internet connection.

#### For PC emulator players

 To run PUBG MOBILE through Tencent Gaming Buddy (the official PC emulator for PUBG Mobile), you will need the following specifications:

##### The minimum system requirements

| CPU:     | Dual core from Intel or AMD at 1.8 GHz                         |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Memory:  | at least**3 GB** of RAM                                        |
| GPU:     | NVIDIA GeForce 8600 / 9600 GT, ATI / AMD Radeon HD 2600 / 3600 |
| OS:      | Windows 10, 8.1, 8 and 7                                       |
| DirectX: | Version 9.0c                                                   |

### Bonus tip: How to make the game run smoothly on my computer?

 Many emulator players reported that the game often become stuttering after they play it for a while. This is a very common problem on the PC emulator. Normally, there’re three factors that can trigger this issue: the PC hardware specifications, the in-game video settings and the optimization of the emulator itself.

 For the last factor, there’s nothing we can do to improve the situation, since it requires the developer of the emulator to optimize it. So here we just talk about the first two factors.

 If the specifications of your computer is not so good, you should use the recommended in-game video settings. If the specifications of your PC is good enough, you may need to update your drivers, since the emulator uses heavily on CPU and GPU.

 There’re two methods to update your drivers:**manually** and **automatically** .

#### **Update your drivers manually**

 You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your device. Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact device model and your version of Windows.

 **Or**

#### **Update your drivers automatically**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
