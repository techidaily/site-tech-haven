2. **[Set Java as a priority](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Close unnecessary programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Plug your laptop into a power source (for laptop users)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-make-minecraft-run-faster/#t4)**
5. **[Install the latest drivers for your graphics card](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Consider upgrading your computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### 1\. Give Minecraft more RAM

 RAM (Random Access Memory) is an internal memory that exchanges data directly with the CPU. RAM is like a temporary storage area between the CPU and the hard disk. The data that the CPU needs to access and the process will pass through RAM. So when you run a game, the game is actually running in the RAM. Therefore, giving Minecraft more RAM can increase the speed of the game.  
 Here’s how:

1. Check your installed memory by pressing the**Windows logo key + Pause key** together. You’ll see how much RAM space you have.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ram.jpg)
2. Run Minecraft, and click the menu button in the right-topper corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mine1-1.jpg)
3. Click**Lauch options** \>**Advanced settings** \>**Add new** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mine2-1.jpg)
4. Add a name then click**JVM arguments** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mine3.jpg)
5. Change the**Xmx2G** into**Xmx4G** . Xmx2G means Xmx 2 gigabytes of RAM, you can change 2 into 4 or 8 as you like. Then click**Save** .  
**Note** : You can never have more RAM dedicated than you have installed on your computer. And there’s no need to add more than 75% of your RAM for Minecraft.

6. Back to the**News** tab, click the arrow button beside**PLAY** and choose the name you add.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mine5-1.jpg)
7. Click**PLAY** to check.

### 2\. Set Java as a priority

 This method may not very effective but it’s still worth trying. Java is an important software for Minecraft. So giving it enough room to run smoothly will help speed up Minecraft.

1. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** together to open the Task Manager.
2. Click Details.
3. Right-click on Java, and choose**Set priority > High** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/java.jpg)

### 3.**Close unnecessary programs**

 Programs in the background can have an impact on Minecraft performance. Many programs will take valuable resources and slow down the Minecraft running speed. You can open Task Manager to end these unnecessary programs.

1. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** together to open the Task Manager.
2. Choose the program and click**End task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/end-task.jpg)

### 4\. Plug your laptop into a power source (for laptop users)

 GPU and CPU need enough power to fully work. If the laptop battery is in a low state, many laptops will automatically throttle the GPU and CPU and slow down Minecraft. For better game performance, make sure you have a full-filled battery or plug the power plug while playing the game.

### 5.**Install the latest drivers for your graphics card**

 Like games, manufacturers keep releasing new drivers. An outdated or missing driver may cause problems. To make your computer run properly, it’s also important to keep your drivers up to date.

There are two ways to update drivers.

**Option 1 — Manually** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**Option 2 — Automatically (Recommended)** – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.
