### 1\. Give Minecraft more RAM

 RAM (Random Access Memory) is an internal memory that exchanges data directly with the CPU. RAM is like a temporary storage area between the CPU and the hard disk. The data that the CPU needs to access and the process will pass through RAM. So when you run a game, the game is actually running in the RAM. Therefore, giving Minecraft more RAM can increase the speed of the game.  
 Here’s how:

1. Check your installed memory by pressing the**Windows logo key + Pause key** together. You’ll see how much RAM space you have.

### 2\. Set Java as a priority

 This method may not very effective but it’s still worth trying. Java is an important software for Minecraft. So giving it enough room to run smoothly will help speed up Minecraft.

1. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** together to open the Task Manager.
2. Click Details.
3. Right-click on Java, and choose**Set priority > High** .

### 3.**Close unnecessary programs**

 Programs in the background can have an impact on Minecraft performance. Many programs will take valuable resources and slow down the Minecraft running speed. You can open Task Manager to end these unnecessary programs.

1. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** together to open the Task Manager.
2. Choose the program and click**End task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/end-task.jpg)

### 4\. Plug your laptop into a power source (for laptop users)

 GPU and CPU need enough power to fully work. If the laptop battery is in a low state, many laptops will automatically throttle the GPU and CPU and slow down Minecraft. For better game performance, make sure you have a full-filled battery or plug the power plug while playing the game.

### 5.**Install the latest drivers for your graphics card**

 Like games, manufacturers keep releasing new drivers. An outdated or missing driver may cause problems. To make your computer run properly, it’s also important to keep your drivers up to date.

There are two ways to update drivers.

**Option 1 — Manually** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**Option 2 — Automatically (Recommended)** – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-18.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to the driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with Free version).  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-Geoforce.jpg)

### 6.**Consider upgrading your computer**

 If your computer is old and can’t meet the minimum requirement of Minecraft, Minecraft certainly will run slowly. It’s recommended to upgrade your computer to get a better gaming experience.
