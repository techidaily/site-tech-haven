Apple [may have unveiled the new Apple Pencil Pro earlier this month](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-will-announce-at-its-ipad-event-on-may-7-ipad-pro-air-pencil-and-more/), but the older Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) is [still compatible with new iPad models](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-pencil-pro-vs-apple-pencil-2/), and Amazon is discounting the [Apple Pencil (2nd Gen)](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Pencil-2nd-Generation-Pixel-Perfect-Precision-Industry-Leading-Low-Latency-Perfect-Note-Taking-Drawing-Signing-documents-Attaches-Charges-Pairs%2F949679706&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) from $130 to just $95 ahead of Labor Day weekend.

The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) was first launched in 2018 and has remained one of the [best iPad stylus](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad-stylus/) options ever since. Right now, you can swipe one up for just $95, a savings of $35.

[Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) for $95 (save $50) at Walmart View now at Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Pencil-2nd-Generation-Pixel-Perfect-Precision-Industry-Leading-Low-Latency-Perfect-Note-Taking-Drawing-Signing-documents-Attaches-Charges-Pairs%2F949679706&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp)

This Apple Pencil builds on the first-generation model with a double-tap function that you can customize to switch between pencil and eraser, show the color palettes, and more, as well as attach to the side of the [iPad Pro](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLF2BRM%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C01773aa8-2d2b-47b8-a84a-8cf1719286e0%7Cdtp&dtb=1) and charge wirelessly.

**Also:** [**The best iPad stylus you can buy**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad-stylus/)

The Apple Pencil is super responsive and has pixel-perfect precision with industry-leading low latency for writing, markup, or drawing. It also has tilt sensitivity and palm-rejection technology, so the screen only recognizes the Apple Pencil, not your hand or finger.

By using the Apple Pencil with your iPad (specifically, the iPad Pro 2022 model), you'll get exclusive features like the new hover feature that makes part of the iPad's interface come to life when the tip of the Apple Pencil gets within 12mm of the iPad's display. 

Get the [Apple Pencil (2nd Gen)](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Pencil-2nd-Generation-Pixel-Perfect-Precision-Industry-Leading-Low-Latency-Perfect-Note-Taking-Drawing-Signing-documents-Attaches-Charges-Pairs%2F949679706&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) with $35 in savings right now if you want to upgrade your iPad stylus.
