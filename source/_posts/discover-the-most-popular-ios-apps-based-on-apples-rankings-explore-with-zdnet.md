"There's an app for that" is probably a phrase you've said or heard many times in the last 15 years since Apple's revolutionary iPhone popularized mobile apps. The average American has 80 apps downloaded on their phone, according to [a Zippia study](https://www.zippia.com/advice/mobile-app-industry-statistics/#:~:text=The%20average%20American%20has%2080,app%20downloads%20worldwide%20in%202020.). The same study found that there are over 2 million apps on the [Apple App Store](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-reveals-the-best-apps-of-2022/).

**Also:** [**I spent a weekend with Amazon's free AI courses, and highly recommend you do too**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/unlock-ai-secrets-transform-your-skills-with-amazons-free-ai-learning/)

Out of the millions of apps available on the App Store, a few transform digital culture and help us get the most out of our digital experiences. 

From apps that help us learn languages and find the best flight deals to games that encourage us to build sustainable digital cities, behind every game and app is a team whose goal is to bring a digital experience to life.

To honor these app and game developers, designers, and creators, Apple's App Store Editors curated 2023's annual App and Game of the Year list for [iPhone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/), [iPad](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/), [Mac](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-mac/), [Apple Watch](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/), Apple TV, and Apple Arcade.

**Also: [Boost your security and productivity with the best Mac apps](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-mac-app/)**
