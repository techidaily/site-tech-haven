## Unlocking the Ultimate Fan Experience on iPhone - Dive Into Apple'er Free Sporting App, as Highlighted

![Apple Sports.](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/1b2907d592e630cff64ce536c02bf104f2167cee/2024/02/21/cb8675ea-92f8-418e-95a6-d50dbe96ae41/apple-sports.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

Apple just launched a new free iPhone app -- called Apple Sports -- that gives sports fans a personalized experience, making it easier to follow their teams' and leagues' scores and statistics. 

After users [download the app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-sports/id6446788829) on their iPhones, they choose their favorite leagues and teams. Each day, the Apple Sports app will display that day's scheduled matchups and results; users can swipe left to view the previous day's results, complete with a summary, play-by-play, and box score, or swipe right to view their favorite teams' upcoming games.

Each matchup is shown in a card format, where you see a summary for each game as you scroll through the cards and then choose one that you want to expand to show more information. This makes for an intuitive interaction; however, the app is still young, and the navigation shows it. 

While the stats are rich -- you want from a sports app -- there's a lot of wasted space on the screen begging for a more compact visual design.

However, one great thing about the Apple Sports app is the lack of ads. Though I don't believe Apple will add advertisements to its Sports app, I wouldn't be surprised to see it incorporate a paid service or subscription model for extra features down the line, in the manner of Apple News. I expect Apple will take a similar approach to how it runs its soccer-focused MLS Season Pass, which the company uses to promote the Apple Sports app and vice-versa. 

 Apple Sports gives users access to leagues like the MLS, NBA, NCAA basketball, NHL, and European football leagues. More leagues -- including the MLB, NFL, and WNBA -- will be added once their respective seasons begin.

The Apple Sports app is available for download in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-sports/id6446788829) and works on iOS 17.2 or later for iPhone users in the US, UK, and Canada.
