The summer season has nearly come and gone, but one of the hottest deals is live now: a [9th-generation iPad](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9FPHY6%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C496b2b3c-e6b2-4864-903a-36622334cc02%7Cdtp&dtb=1) for $199 -- a discount of $130, thanks to Amazon's [Labor Day](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/best-labor-day-amazon-deals-2024/) sale.

At Amazon, Apple's 9th-generation iPad with a 10.2-inch screen is down to $199, $130 cheaper than its standard starting price. This gets you 64GB of storage and Wi-Fi only. We haven't seen a deal on an iPad this good this year, so you'll want to jump on this as soon as you can.

The [9th-generation iPad](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9FPHY6%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C496b2b3c-e6b2-4864-903a-36622334cc02%7Cdtp&dtb=1), originally released in 2021, is at the bottom of Apple's lineup as its entry-level offering. Despite that, this is still an excellent tablet if all you need is a Netflix machine, something to check emails with or do some shopping, or a distraction for your kids. The design is pretty dated with chunky bezels and a Home button with Touch ID, but it's perfectly functional. (I actually still enjoy holding this iPad in particular since you have somewhere for your thumbs to go without blocking the screen.)

**Read the review:** [**Apple iPad (2021): If it's not broke, don't fix it**](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-ipad-2021/)

Apple includes a 10.2-inch Retina display that's perfectly adequate for streaming your favorite movies, reading ebooks, gaming, and even drawing thanks to Apple Pencil support. Inside there's an A13 Bionic processor, the same chip as the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, which provides speedy performance and many years of software updates (expect this iPad to get at least a few more years' worth of iOS upgrades if history is any indication).

You'll also get 10 hours of battery life, stereo speakers, front and rear cameras, and the coveted Lightning port, perfect for anyone who hasn't made the switch to USB-C just yet. While it won't give you the blazing-fast speeds or impeccable display technology of an iPad Pro, for under $200, [this iPad](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9FPHY6%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C496b2b3c-e6b2-4864-903a-36622334cc02%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is a great deal. But hop on it fast -- the deal could be gone before you know it.
