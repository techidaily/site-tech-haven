 If Windows Update fails to update your DirectX for you, you can try to install the update manually.

## Install DirectX End-User Runtime

 To do so, you need to install the DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer from here: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35&msclkid=925e9033c66c11ec8cedbba96a57a2fb](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35&msclkid=925e9033c66c11ec8cedbba96a57a2fb)
