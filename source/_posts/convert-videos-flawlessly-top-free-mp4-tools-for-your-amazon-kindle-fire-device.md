Yes, the free Kindle Video Converter can't convert DRM protected media!  
 If you want to remove DRM from purchased Media please download this DRM Media Converter ![](http://www.epubor.com/EgeCMSInfoStyle/pic/url.gif)<http://www.epubor.com/drm-media-converter.html>

Drop the file directly into your Kindle drive, not a folder. After disconnect, go to APP tab, then Gallery. SD Card - videos should be there.

I received a kindle fire for christmas and wanted to convert an AVI file to MP4 so it would play. I used this program and the file went from 700MB avi file to 3.3 GB MP4 file. I thought that it was supposed to make smaller files? Is there something else that I need to do to make files smaller so they will work on my fire.

@C Reiter

 Check the videos Under Apps Menu&gt;Gallery and NOT under Video menu

Converted AVI to MP4 but NO AUDIO, any ideas??? Also noticed the doubling of file size; 1.36gb AVI to 2.6gb mp4, what's up with that?? Especially if there's no audio, why the larger size??

Thanks for the program, simple interface and free but had to delete, could not get sound despite running program on three different computers and file size issue prohibitive on a Kindle with only 5gb user available space. Used an alternate program and worked beautifully.

Avi to Mp4 Converter & Total Video Converter. Itâ€™s a very powerful Video Converter. Convert any video files to 3gp, mp4, psp, iPod, iPhone, flv, DVD, VCD.
