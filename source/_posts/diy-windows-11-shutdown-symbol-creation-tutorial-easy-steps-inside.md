But why spend the extra energy when you can do it in two? All you have to do is create a shutdown icon, and you'll save yourself some time.

##  Create a Shutdown Icon

 To create a shutdown icon, right-click your Desktop, hover over "New," and then select "Shortcut."

![RIght-click your desktop, then go to New > Shortcut.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-17.png) 

 The "Create Shortcut" menu appears. In the text box under "Type the location of the item," type the following command and then click "Next":

        `Shutdown.exe /s /t 00`
    
![Enter shutdown command](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Enter-shutdown-command-1.png) 

 In the next window, type a name for your new shortcut if you want. "Shutdown" is the default, so we'll leave it that for this example.

 Click "Finish" to finish the setup process.

 Your new shutdown icon will appear on your Desktop.

 Now, whenever you double-click the icon, your PC will shut down instantly.

 If you'd like your icon to have a shortcut, just right-click the icon and select "Properties."
