**5\. Can I convert Audible to MP3 on Android?**\--Currently, there is no AAX to MP3 Android Converter. I know many Audible users choose to download the Audible books via Audible for Android because they cannot find "Download" option on Audible website. Epubor Audible Converter allows users to login to Audible with Epubor Audible Converter and give you the "Download Audible as MP3" option. 

**Can I convert Audible to MP3 format?** This is one of the most frequently asked questions when it comes to listening to Audible books. Why? Almost all audiobooks downloaded from Audible are locked by Audible DRM and limited to Audible's proprietary format. You may argue that you have legally purchased Audible books and should be able to play them on any device as you like. The fact is that Audible books cannot be played on non-Audible-approved devices, which is decided by Audible. 

In contrast, MP3 is the most popular audio file type and can be played on almost all audio players. It is easy to understand why everyone wants to convert Audible to MP3 nowadays. 

Here are 5 different ways to converting Audible files to MP3 format , each with its pros and cons. Among these methods, **[Epubor Audible Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/audible-converter/)** is highly recommended because of its outstanding features.

If given the option, you can choose to burn the file across multiple CDs.

To convert the burned audiobook CD to MP3, open the "**General Preferences**" in iTunes by clicking "**Edit > Preferences**". Then, click "**Import Settings**" and make sure that "**MP3 Encoder**" is selected. Click "**OK**" to save the changes.

### 4\. Convert Audible to MP3 Online

We have tried numerous online Audible converters and found that only a few are currently functional with Audible files.

Also, to use the online audible to mp3 service, you need to download audible files to your computer first. If you cannot locate your downloaded audible book, please read [Where are Audible Books Stored on PC/MAC/Android/Kindle Devices](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). 

#### Method 1\. Convertio--not working

Although Convertio audio converter is often recommended by many people, our testing has shown that it does not provide satisfactory results for converting Audible files to MP3\. It is clear that Convertio audio converter does not support Audible aax to mp3 conversion. So you can just pass this option.

#### Method 2\. Online-audio-converter.com

If you are still interested in the free online audible converter, we suggest giving [Audio Converter online](https://online-audio-converter.com/) a try. Follow the below steps to convert audible to mp3 online.

1 Upload the Audible files online

You can upload the Audible books from your computer, Google Drive, Dropbox or URL. Please keep in mind that **the maximum size for uoloads is 10 MB**. If your file is large than 10MB, "conversion error occurs" will appear when you convert it.

2 Convert Audible file

After uploading your file to the website, select MP3 as the output format, then click on the "Convert" icon to begin the conversion process. Once the conversion is complete, click the "Download" button to save the MP3 file to your computer.

It's important to note that this online Audible to mp3 converter requires a constant internet connection. If your internet goes down, you won't be able to use this method. Additionally, you'll need to upload your .aa or .aax files every time you want to convert them, which can be time-consuming. Furthermore, this method isn't recommended because most Audible books are larger than the 10MB maximum file size allowed by the converter.

**Pros:** 
* It is free.
**Cons:** 
* The online Audible converter has a file size limit of 10MB. It cannot handle larger audible files.

As far as the MAC system is concerned, the Audible audiobooks are currently no longer downloaded directly but can be: 1) listen directly with the computer through a software managed directly by Audible; 2) listen by downloading them on Iphone where there is a library manageable through the Audible IOS software. This library is probably contained in the Audible Documents folder which is a protected folder and therefore not accessible. Therefore to date in the MAC system it is not possible to get hold of the audiobooks files to be able to then unprotect them by Epubor Audible Converter. Do you have alternative solutions to propose?
