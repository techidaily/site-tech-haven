We have to admit that audio books is a great creation for those people who prefer listening to audio files to reading paper books or e-books. Audiobooks are another way for us to take literature anywhere we want to go, letting us listen to the latest bestseller while on a long drive or doing some chores. The most I like about audiobooks is that it's very efficient for me to know the book content and it can keep me from getting distracted.

So the audiobook player app is becoming very necessary for us to listen to audiobooks on our mobile devices. You might wonder why you need a specific app. After all, audiobooks are just audio files. So why not just use a regular music player? It's true that most audiobooks will play just fine on audio players. But audiobooks tend to be long and complex with lots of chapters. That's why you really need a dedicated app that can organize your books neatly and logically and has variable playback speed. So in this article I am mainly going to introduce 7 best audiobook apps for your Android device. By the way, here's the [best 6 Audiobook Apps for iOS devices](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). 

#### 1\. Audible

[Audible](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.audible.application&hl=en) is the leading app in world of audio books. Available and free, you can download it anytime form your Google play store. Audible's audiobook player offers solid playback features, with chapter navigation, bookmarks, a sleep mode, variable playback speed and multitasking support for background playback and downloading. Its increasing integration with Amazon's Kindle system is reaping added benefits for its users, as Kindle users can pay a small fee to upgrade a Kindle ebook with an Audible audiobook; Amazon's Whispersync allows users to switch between audiobook and text near-seamlessly.

#### 2\. LibriVox

[Librivox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.librivox.android&hl=en) is a non-commercial, non-profit and ad-free project which maintains a loose and open structure, donates its recordings to the public domain and powered by volunteers. Here you can view the most popular books, browse by titles, authors or genres or just search by keywords. The app also provided many narrators for each book so that the app users can listen to their favorite narrators. While containing all kinds of controlling features such as sleep timer, variable speed and bookmarks, the app also allows its user to listen to multiple books at the same time.

#### 3\. Smart Audiobook Player

If you're looking to listen to DRM-free audiobooks already in your collection, [Smart Audiobook Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer&hl=en) is a popular choice for Android devices that comes with a good selection of features, such as variable playback speed, bookmarking, an audio equalizer, some basic collection management features, a sleep timer and control widgets for the notification tray and your home screen. The app provides users with a generous 30-day free trial before asking for a $1.99 unlock.

#### 4\. Audiobooks.com

Simply Audiobooks' cloud-based [Audiobooks.com](https://www.audiobooks.com/) platform also offers a solid audiobook app for Android listeners, allowing subscribers to choose from a library of more than 45,000 audiobooks from every genre that they can stream or download for offline listening. The Audio Books app includes variable playback speed, automatic bookmarking and a sleep timer, among other features. Additionally, this app includes cross-device syncing, allowing listeners to easily transition from their smartphone, tablet or computer without losing their place in the audiobook.

#### 5\. Overdrive

Another audiobook option to consider is your local library if it has a digital media lending system. [OverDrive](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overdrive.mobile.android.mediaconsole&hl=en) is a media management app that allows users to borrow ebooks and audiobooks from their library's collection, with all the flexibility and convenience of a digital app. OverDrive users can borrow titles from the library's collection 24/7, and users can create holds, wishlists and effortlessly return ebooks and audiobooks. Cross-device syncing of titles and bookmarks allow you the flexibility to listen to an audiobook on the device of your choice.

#### 6\. Downpour

[Downpour](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackstonehybrid&hl=en) is an independent audiobook store with a fantastic library of DRM-free audiobooks for sale, as well as select audiobooks that you can rent for 30 or 60 days through the Downpour mobile app. The Downpour app allows users to access their entire library and download audiobooks on Wi-Fi or cellular networks for offline playback. Playback controls are fairly standard with chapter and 30-second skips, bookmarking, a sleep timer and support for background downloading and playback.

#### 7\. Listen Audiobooks Player

Another well-regarded player for DRM-free audiobooks on Android is [Listen Audiobooks Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acmeandroid.listen&hl=en), formerly known as Akimbo. Ad and IAP-free, Listen is a highly configurable player that includes variable playback speed, a built-in equalizer, sleep timer, embedded chapter support, bookmarks, lockscreen controls, and widgets. Users can sync their current position and bookmarks across multiple devices, configure skip times, UI colors, and configure headset button shortcuts.

One thing you may have noticed is that Audible audibooks come with DRM protection, however, all these audiobook player can't be used to listen to DRM protected audiobooks. Fortunately, [Epubor Audible Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/audible-converter/) allows users to easily strip Audible DRM and convert to MP3/M4B with the fast speed. Therefore, your purchased Audible Audiobooks can be played on any device you like!

Great article I stumbled across this write up because I'm looking for a tool that will organise my DRM free audiobooks that I've downloaded.my player lumps them all together so that they're out of sequence.sometimes the audio files will go track 1,12,5,20 etc. I'd like to find an audiobook management system that will put them in sequential order if you could let me know what program/app would work best on my Android phone I'd greatly appreciate it thanks

Another way to listen to audiobooks on any mobile phone with a web browser (all have one) is AudioWeb by MollieSoft. You can just keep your audiobooks on your PC. AudioWeb creates a web server on your PC and you can access it through any web browser. It has bookmarks/explore/search.

I have a bunch of audiobooks that are mp3 that I listen to on my computer. Do any of the ones listed above allow that? I've tried a couple but mp3 format or even selecting your own folder to choose an audiobook from seems to be a no-no. Some advice please?

Definitely Smart AudioBook Player for android, can search through your files for a specific folder, organizes audio book chapters as a single book and doesn't list each chapter as an individual books as other apps do
