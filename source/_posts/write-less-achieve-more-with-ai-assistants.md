## Teachable Tastebuds: Exploring Cooking Lessons with ChatGPT for Healthier Eating

 The wildly popular ChatGPT has affected the way people write code, conduct research, and even learn. But how well does ChatGPT work in the kitchen? Here’s what happened when we used the AI app to teach us how to cook delicious and healthy meals.

## 1\. How to Get Basic Recipes and Tips on ChatGPT

 For the most part, ChatGPT handles basic recipe and cooking questions well. Prompts like “what's a healthy recipe for salmon?” or “how do I make a salad that tastes good?” provide fine responses for starter recipes.

 In addition, the chatbot can assist with everyday cooking questions, such as providing helpful techniques for preparing eggs in a more nutritious way upon request. With its ability to provide immediate and tailored advice, this feature offers a practical resource for anyone looking to make healthier and more informed cooking choices.

![ChatGPT healthier eggs tips](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-healthier-eggs-tips.jpg)

 Healthier cooking options are just a simple prompt away. If you're already a fan of the[best healthy eating apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-healthy-eating-apps/) , such as Mealime, then ChatGPT can offer similar recipes and advice. Because you can keep asking ChatGPT to refine its answers or omit any ingredients, however, it's a more interactive option than standard recipe collections.

## 2\. Refine Your Prompts for Personalized ChatGPT Recipe Selections

 More specific prompts like “design a healthy breakfast with adequate protein and vegetables” or “what's a healthy, vegetarian dinner with spices like turmeric and red pepper?” also provide appropriate recipes. Get as specific as you like with the prompts.

 Don't feel like visiting the grocery store? Note the ingredients you already have on hand and the app can (usually) find an appropriate recipe.

 It can also streamline your grocery shopping process. Prompt it to "please provide a healthy grocery shopping list" or "create a shopping list for a week's worth of lunch salads with plenty of protein." This option is perfect for those days when you don't have the brainpower to think about cooking.

## 3\. Get ChatGPT to Teach You Cooking Skills in a Variety of Ways

 Assign roles or an audience to the app to learn about cooking in the way you prefer. For instance, the prompt “come up with a fun recipe for vegetables for a five-year-old please” provides a cute recipe for Super Veggie Kabobs.

![ChatGPT healthy meal for kids directions](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-healthy-meal-for-kids-part-2-1.jpg)

 Meanwhile, the prompt “please provide a healthy vegetable recipe as though you are an upscale professional chef” offers a recipe for Seared Asparagus with Lemon-Herb Gremolata. With plenty of fresh herbs for flavor, it's a delicious addition to any meal. Who knew the chatbot had such elegant taste?

 In other words, use your prompts to find recipes that suit your needs and interests. Tailor them to your family's nutritional needs, or try out different types of cuisine from around the world.

## Does ChatGPT Provide Useful Nutritional Information?

 ChatGPT is (admirably) cautious about offering nutritional information. When prompted to provide nutritional information for the seared asparagus recipe, it responded: “As an AI language model, I am not able to provide exact nutritional information for recipes.”

 Although it didn't provide a comprehensive breakdown of the dish's nutritional value, it did give some insight into the vitamins that are present in the food and their advantages. This information can be useful when you're looking to make more informed choices about what you're eating, but the app doesn't attempt to oversell anything.

 You can drill down further with a prompt like "Pretend you are a professional nutritionist. What should I know about eating healthily?" Then, the chatbot will offer general information about eating a variety of fruits and vegetables and staying hydrated. These basic principles of healthy eating are helpful guidelines; however, it is worth noting that your own dietary needs and requirements may vary depending on factors such as age, sex, physical activity level, and underlying health conditions.

 When asked to reveal sources for its nutritional information, the app refers to “dietary guidelines and recommendations from reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the American Heart Association (AHA),” as well as “peer-reviewed scientific literature on nutrition, health, and wellness from reputable journals and research institutions.”

 It also offers the caveat that nutritional science is still evolving and recommends consulting with a registered dietitian or healthcare professional for more personalized information. If you want some additional resources, then check out the[best websites to learn more about healthy eating](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-websites-learn-healthy-eating/) , including Nutritionfacts.org and Open Food Facts.

## Boost Your Healthy Cooking Skills With ChatGPT

 With its vast selection of recipes, ChatGPT is a helpful companion for any home chef looking to create healthy meals. While the exact number of recipes it has available is difficult to pin down, the chatbot's endlessly adjustable recipe options will help you create fantastic meals for quite some time. Because it's so easy to use—and fantastically free from advertisements or off-topic ramblings—ChatGPT is an excellent resource for online recipes and cooking advice.
