## The Upgraded Exterior Screen: Discover the Improvements in Samsung Galaxy Z Fold N-Series

Samsung just revealed the Galaxy Z Fold 6 at the company’s Unpacked event. It’s the company’s new book-style folding phone, with an improved aspect ratio and some under-the-hood hardware improvements.

 The new Galaxy Z Fold 6 is still a book-style folding phone, just like last year’s Galaxy Z Fold 5, with opens to reveal a large square screen on the inside. The new model has a wider design, making the slim external screen more like a typical smartphone display, and giving the internal screen a wider square aspect ratio. Samsung says the updated screen size “provides a more natural bar-type viewing experience.”

 The main screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a 7.6-inch AMOLED screen, with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate and a resolution of 2160 x 1856\. The cover screen is a 6.3-inch AMOLED, with a 22:1.9 aspect ratio, 2376 x 968 resolution, and same 120Hz refresh rate. The phone is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chipset, which is the same chipset used by the Galaxy S24 series, and there’s a 4,400mAh battery.

 There are three main cameras: a 50MP primary camera (F1.8), a 12MP ultra-wide lens (F2.2), and a 10MP telephoto (F24) with 3x optical zoom. That’s not bad at all, but it’s still lagging behind the camera used in Samsung’s other flagship phones—the [Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-profit-strategies-for-vimeo-content-creators/) has a 200MP main camera and an additional 50MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom, for example. All those cameras and sensors take up space and increase the depth of the phone, and that’s not an option for folding phones without turning them into bricks.

 Samsung has also further improved durability with the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which is still an issue for all folding phones, especially with long-term screen damage. There’s a new “dual rail hinge structure” with a stronger folding edge, which should reduce damage from external impacts. The frame and hinge housing is also built with ‘Armor Aluminum,’ but not the volume and side buttons. The front and back uses Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, which is the same ruggedized glass [used in the Galaxy S23](https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/news/news-releases/2023/01/samsung-first-to-use-corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2.html) and other recent Samsung devices.

 You’ll be able to [buy the Galaxy Z Fold 6](https://howl.link/2ghvmyray0z6d) starting at $1,900 in three colors: Silver Shadow, Pink, and Navy. That’s a lot of money to spend on a phone with a screen that still degrades more easily than a typical non-folding smartphone. Samsung is trying to sweeten the deal by throwing in 12 months of Samsung Care+ when you pre-order a carrier version, and trade-in deals can take out some of the cost. There’s also the [Galaxy Z Flip 6](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/no-cash-all-fun-turning-twitter-vids-into-gifs-for-2024/) to consider.
