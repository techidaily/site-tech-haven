Apple just unveiled [new AirPods](https://www.zdnet.com/article/which-apple-airpods-4-model-should-you-buy-here-are-the-key-differences/), and while you might be considering buying the brand's latest headphones, you shouldn't forget about the sweet, sweet discounts that activate on earlier models once Apple releases new hardware. If you aren't interested in the new products, think about the deal you can get on a competitive pair of older AirPods, like the AirPods Pro 2\. The AirPods Pro (second generation), which are some of our [favorite earbuds](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-earbuds/) and our [top pick out of the AirPods lineup](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-airpods/), are [on sale at Amazon for $60 off](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1XD1ZV3%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C9bd6ca17-d0b8-4bfa-bfb3-cd6d1a7334ce%7Cdtp&dtb=1), bringing the price down to $190.

These are the AirPods that are also getting a major free software update that will turn them into [clinical-grade hearing aids](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-airpods-pro-2-are-getting-a-free-audio-upgrade-and-its-the-most-important-one-yet/) sometime this fall. If you're interested, this is a great time to pick up a pair.

[Apple AirPods Pro with USB-C charging case (2nd Generation) for $190 (save $60 at Amazon) $190 at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1XD1ZV3%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C9bd6ca17-d0b8-4bfa-bfb3-cd6d1a7334ce%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

The AirPods Pro (second generation) tops ZDNET's [best AirPods list](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-airpods/), and that's for good reason. The AirPods Pro offer impressive sound quality, immersive noise cancellation, all-day comfort, and a wireless charging case. With six hours of battery life and Apple's latest H2 chip, you're getting the most modern tech in these Apple earbuds.

And, because the case can utilize wireless charging, you can plunk it down on a [MagSafe charger](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-battery/), an Apple Watch charger, or a Qi-compatible charging mat for non-Apple tech products. 

ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner says the pair are the most easily recommendable of the four AirPod models. "That's because they fit almost every type of ear, they are very comfortable to wear, and they include all of the best and latest features that Apple has to offer in headphones. Plus, they get a bonus set of new features as part of the iOS 17 update, which won't come to any of the other AirPods," he [writes](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-airpods/). 

If you're ready to replace that old pair of wired earbuds with one of our favorite wireless earbuds, you might as well hop on this [second-generation AirPods Pro deal](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1XD1ZV3%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C9bd6ca17-d0b8-4bfa-bfb3-cd6d1a7334ce%7Cdtp&dtb=1). But act fast -- the discount won't last long.
