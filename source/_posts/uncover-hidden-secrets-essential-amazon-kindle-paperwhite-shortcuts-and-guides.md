The Kindle Paperwhite has a 6 inch, 212 PPI E Ink Pearl display (758×1024 resolution) with four built-in LEDs to illuminate the screen. The light is one of the main features of the Paperwhite and it has a manually adjusted light level. Battery life is advertised as up to eight weeks of reading with half an hour per day with wireless off and constant light usage; this usage equals 28 hours. This device was the first Kindle to track one's reading speed to estimate when one will finish a chapter of book.

But, are you still just reading Kindle books with it? Haven't you tried reading iBooks EPUB on your Kindle Paperwhite? Are you wondering that is it possible to change the provided screensavers? Do you wish to know how to add dictionary to Kindle?

![kindle paperwhite tips and tricks](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle-paperwhite-tips-and-tricks.jpg)

As a big fans of Kindle, I also concern those questions deeply, so I searched the internet to find out some good solutions, and tried those suggested methods on my Kindle Paperwhite. Based on my own experience, now I finally realize that in fact there are more fantastic things that we can do on Kindle Paperwhite Amazon doesn't want us to know. And this is also the reason that I decide to write this article to show you best 9 Kindle Paperwhite tips and tricks to help you get the most out of your Kindle.

### Trick 1: EPUB books on Kindle Paperwhite

![epub books on kindle paperwhite](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/epub-books-on-kindle-paperwhite.jpg)

Supposing that you received a book from your best friend, he highly recommended you to read this book because he has read it and thought it amazingly interesting. You were so excited to open it, but you got a problem.

This book is an EPUB file. 

You can open this book with Calibre on computer.

You transferred this book to your favorite Kindle Paperwhite.

 But finally your Kindle doesn't show it up!

In fact, almost all my friends including me have encountered this similar problem. The open-source EPUB eBook format is so great for sharing books between different eReaders, but why Amazon's best-seller Kindle Paperwhite doesn't support it?

If you have the same question, this article is for you.

[How to read EPUB on Kindle Paperwhite](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) 

Yes, this is my recommended solution to this problem. It is a powerful Kindle Paperwhite trick to eBooks lovers.

When converting EPUB to Kindle format, this tool [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) is needed.

[](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

It helps convert books from EPUB format to Kindle supported mobi, no matter your EPUB books are with DRM protections or not.

Note that this tool is an all-in-one product that could resolve nearly all your eBooks' problems with your eReaders. It supports ebooks from stores like Google, Apple iBooks, B&N, Rakuten Kobo, Sony, etc.

### Trick 2: How to add and change Kindle dictionary quickly

While looking up a unfamiliar word when reading, Amazon allows us to use their custom dictionaries just by pressing and holding on the words. This is so convenient.

But if you have books in many languages, then you are required to add foreign language dictionary to the Kindle, or switch dictionaries among different languages.

We are so lucky that now it is possible to install some custom dictionaries to Kindle device.

Just download the dictionaries you need. Download the files to your computer, then connect your KPW to your PC, drag the files to your Kindle "documents\\dictionaries" folder. Eject your Kindle, then you need to make the newly added dictionaries work well on your Kindle Paperwhite.

![change kindle paperwhite dictionary](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/change-kindle-paperwhite-dictionary.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Go to Menu > Settings > Device Options > Language and Dictionaries > Dictionaries. Then you can set each one that you want to use.

The default dictionary will be changed quickly. Don't worry it won't remove the existing dictionaries. you will be able to switch between them.

### Trick 3: Add custom fonts to Kindle Paperwhite easily without hacking

You may wonder if there was an easy way to add additional font types to the original list. 

![add fonts to kindle paperwhite](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/add-fonts-to-kindle-paperwhite.jpg)Yes, you can, and you can easily achieve this goal with this trick. All you need to do is just to create a new folder named **"fonts"**, then download some fonts types you like from the internet to this folder. Below the fonts file, create a new text file and rename is as "**USE\_ALT\_FONTS**".

The left job is to let your Kindle adopt the newly added fonts. Reboot your Kindle, then open a book to enjoy! 

This solution only works well on Kindle Paperwhite 1\. For Kindle Paperwhite 2, you can't do anything unless hack your device. 

There is also another easier way to add custom fonts to Kindle Paperwhite. You can click [here](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) to learn more details.

### Trick 4: Jailbreak Kindle Paperwhite

Above I've said that there is something that we couldn't do if you don't hack your Kindle. In other words, only by jailbreaking you can use the device as you wish, such as installing custom screensavers.

**1.** Upgrading or downgrading your Paperwhite's OS to 5.3.5.

Firstly [download](http://ixtab.tk/kindle-touch-updates/update%5Fkindle%5F5.3.5.bin) the appropriate OS .bin file to your computer. Then turn your Kindle into airplane mode, connect to computer, transfer the downloaded .bin file to Kindle. Then eject, choose Menu > Settings > Update Your Kindle.

**Note:** This step is needed only for those people whose Kindle os version is 5.3.4 or 5.3.6.

**2.** Installing thejailbreak files to the correct directories. As what this image shows: 

![installing the jailbreak files](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/download-jailbreak-files-to-kindle-paperwhite.png)

### Trick 5: Change screensavers on Kindle Paperwhite

![change screensaver kindle paperwhite](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle-paperwhite-change-screensaver.jpg)

Now that you have learned how to jailbreak, then the screensavers changing work will become much easier.

First make sure that you have rooted your KPW.

Then install screensaver hack files: [Python pack](http://download.epubor.com/source/kindle-python-0.8.N.zip) and [Screensaver hack](http://download.epubor.com/source/kindle-linkss-0.15.N.zip). After finished downloading, extract your zip file.

Connect Kindle to computer. From the extracted file drag these two files to your Kindle root directory: _**update\_python\_0.x.N\_install.bin**_, _**update\_linkss\_0.1x.N\_install.bin**_.

You say you use Calibre, still you recommend to download another ebook converter ? I personally haave never encountered any better conversion programs than Calibre iitself. Can your other program really do it any better, or with more customisation? Also Kindle's default format isn't MOBI, it's AZW3 as far as I know, anyways Calibre converts easily and automatically(if you want it) to any of these and more. Is there a reason why you don't wanna use Calibre? About fonts, I always change the fonts to one I like when I convert the book with Calibre. Then each book shows up with its custom fonts in Kindle..

Purely ridiculous.

 ANY ePub book converted and uploaded to my Paperwhite using Calibre reads and shows just fine. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE...

 No need for additional software.

Thank you for your comments. We have to admit Calibre is a good ebook converter. But before that you need to ensure your books are DRM free, right? Epubor software can remove DRM from ebooks and convert books to any other format.

I have a Kindle Paperwhite 3\. It does not allow inverting text (showing white text on dark background for night reading. Since the display occasionally does a very quick inverted text when the device is being activated, I know that it is possible for the hardware to do this. But the software does not do it. The new Kindle Paperwhite 4 Does allow this setting. Why can't the OS for the KP-3 be updated to allow this also?
