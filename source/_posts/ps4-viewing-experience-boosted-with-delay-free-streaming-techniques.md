### 1\. Update Firefox

 The first and easiest thing you can do is make sure your Firefox is up to date. This is the most effortless way to speed up Firefox because the developers are making every effort to make Firefox faster and perform better. To check for updates here is how to do it:

 Click the hamburger**menu** button >**Help** \>**About Firefox** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/check-for-updates-1024x653.jpg)

<a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1047974&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-04_%281%29.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Firefox will check for updates for you automatically.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Private Browsing

 To make your Firefox faster, you may need to clear your browsing history regularly. If you don’t really rely on browsing history, you can start private browsing by never remembering history.

 1) Go to**about:preferences#privacy** in the address bar.

 2) Scroll down to**History** .

* Under the**History** tab, select**Never remember history** .
* **Clear History** if you had any.
* **Clear Data** if they’re taking up a lot of space.
* Make sure you’ve checked the box**Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/never-remember-history.jpg)

 Overloaded history will slow your Firefox down. By private browsing, you won’t go through the trouble of deleting them every time.

<a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873313/18544" target="_top" id="1873313"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873313" border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1263"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873313/18544" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Free up memory

 1) Type**about:memory** in the address bar and hit**Enter** .

 2) Under the Free memory section, choose**Minimize memory usage** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/about-memory-1024x608.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Firefox will now release in-use memory that’s no longer needed. This should provide a pretty quick boost in speed.

### 4\. Enable hardware acceleration

 Enabling hardware acceleration will allow Firefox Quantum to take advantage of your GPU to accelerate browsing. You can check if it’s turned on by default.

 1) Go to**about:preferences** .

 2) In General, scroll down to**Performance** .

 3) Uncheck the box**Use recommended performance settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uncheck-the-box-1024x829.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BSysTools%2BOutlook%2BRecovery"><img src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/outlook-recovery.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 4) Check the box for**Use hardware acceleration when available** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/acceleration-1024x829.jpg)

 As for the content limit, it’s set to 8 at default. This can improve performance when using multiple tabs but it will also use more memory. It’s recommended to leave it at default if you have more than 8 GB of RAM. You can reduce the number if it eats up your memory.

 Tip: Press the**Windows logo** key and**Pause/Break** key to check the amount of RAM.

### 5\. Update your graphics driver

 Firefox and some plugins use your graphics card to speed up the display of web content. In addition, advanced web features like WebGL (Web Graphics Library) also need a graphics card to improve performance. To speed up Firefox, you may need to update your graphics card drivers.

 Having outdated drivers might slow down performance. To update your graphics card driver, there are 2 options:**manually** and**automatically** .

#### 1\. Manually

 To update your graphics driver manually, you can get the latest graphics driver from its manufacturer’s website and download & install it step by step.

* For NVIDIA: Go to **[Official Website for NVIDIA Driver Downloads](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* For AMD: Go to [**Official Website for AMD Drivers and Support**](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

#### 2\. Automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can**do it automatically** with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the Scan Now button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/scan-now-2.png)

 3) Click_**Update All**_ to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get**full support** and a**30-day money back guarantee** .)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/update-all-your-drivers-2.jpg)

 Note: You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 6\. Manage your tabs

 If you are used to keeping many tabs open, you can try an extension called[Auto Tab Discard](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/auto-tab-discard/) to reduce your memory usage by hibernating inactive tabs. Also, you can whitelist the tabs you want active all the time.

 To get it, go to**Add-ons** \>**Extensions** and search for**Auto Tab Discard** , then add it to your Firefox.

 You can enter**Options** to change the settings as you wish. Just don’t forget to scroll down the page to**Save Options** .

5) Restart your Firefox for the changes to take effect.

### 8\. Safe Mode

 Browsing in safe mode lets you run Firefox without any add-ons and themes. If you find your Firefox runs faster this way, you can remove your add-ons and use the default theme.

 1) Open the**menu** and select**Help** .

 2) Select**Restart with Add-ons Disabled** . Click**Restart** when you’re prompted for permission to restart your Firefox.
