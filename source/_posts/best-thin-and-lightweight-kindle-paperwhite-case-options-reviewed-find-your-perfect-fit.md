To be sure, Kindle Paperwhite is the best choice for eBook-lover. When you have it, you will find that the screen is easy to attract scratches, so keeping it safe at all times is imperative. A protective case is not expensive and it not only offers protection but it’s a feast for the eyes. The key is to make sure the protective case as light as possible, and make it easy to carry about.

Buying the Kindle Paperwhite and the case may very well be a one-stop Amazon shopping, but before you make a final decision, check how many wonderful cases for your device can be found across the entire website. With so many cases, how to find the most suitable one? Below you’ll see the most slim Kindle Paperwhite cases. I’ve done a hard work, so that you can quickly jump to the most slim case.

You can also look into JOEV Collections Kindle Covers, made from genuine leather leather which is hand rubbed & aged with leather dye. All sleep wake functionality include and very reasonable prices
