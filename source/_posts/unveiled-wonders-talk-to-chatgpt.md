## Unlock the Power of Conversation: Talk with ChatGPT Today

 Have you ever imagined conversing with an AI that understands and can respond to you with your voice? OpenAI's open-source speech recognition system called "Whisper" allows you to speak to ChatGPT and get answers to your questions.

 You can use this feature to generate codes, get answers, or have a quick brainstorming session with just your voice.

## What You Need to Speak to ChatGPT

 ChatGPT's Whisper integration allows you to use your voice to speak with ChatGPT instead of typing. The beauty of this lies in the fact that you can speed up your prompts instead of typing long and descriptive sentences.

 To access ChatGPT's voice input feature on your phone, you'll need to download and install the official ChatGPT app for mobile devices. Once you sign in with your OpenAI account, you're all set to take advantage of the Whisper feature.
