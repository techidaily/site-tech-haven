## FAQs about drivers and Driver Easy…

### What is a device driver?

 A device driver is a computer program that enables your hardware devices  
 (such as a sound card, graphics card, keyboard and mouse) to communicate with Windows Operating System. Pretty much like an interpreter between the two, it translates Windows commands into instructions your devices understand so that the hardware works properly on your computer.

### Why do I need to keep my drivers updated?

 Updating drivers should always be your go-to option when something goes wrong with your computer or system.

 Every so often people blame Windows or hardware devices when their computer has problems. But the truth is, the computer problem is usually caused by something else – problem drivers. An outdated/wrong/incorrectly installed driver can cause various problems in sound, images, keyboard, mouse… among which the most notorious one is the blue screen of death.

 Updating your drivers also helps to get the best out of your computer hardware. With the latest drivers, you can expect richer sound quality, greater visual fidelity, faster Internet connection and smoother game play…
