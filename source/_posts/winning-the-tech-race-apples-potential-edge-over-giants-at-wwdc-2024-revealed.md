As we approach [WWDC 2024](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-confirms-wwdc-2024-for-june-10-will-ai-steal-the-show/) on June 10, it's clear that this will be among the most important developer events in Apple's history. The progress made by competitors such as Microsoft and Google -- who have incorporated significant generative AI features into their products and services -- means Apple must not merely catch up but surpass their advancements.

Recently, Microsoft integrated the GPT-4-based [Copilot](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-copilot-formerly-bing-chat-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) into its latest [Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite X-based PCs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-lenovos-new-snapdragon-x-elite-laptops-and-theyre-scary-thin/), and Google is incorporating its [Deepmind Gemini GenAI models](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-openai-sweating-9-google-features-announced-for-gemini-search-android-and-more/) across its ecosystem. Apple, as of now, is behind.

**Also: [The M4 iPad Pro's true potential will be realized at WWDC, and AI will have a lot to do with it](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-m4-ipad-pros-true-potential-will-be-realized-at-wwdc-and-ai-will-have-a-lot-to-do-with-it/)**

Apple's hardware, including the AI-powered M4 chip, has tremendous potential. However, [hardware alone is insufficient](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-m4-ipad-pros-true-potential-will-be-realized-at-wwdc-and-ai-will-have-a-lot-to-do-with-it/). Consumers are looking for significant software innovations that enhance their user experience. Apple must demonstrate that its hardware advancements are crucial for the next generation of digital experiences, unlocking new AI capabilities and augmented reality interactions.

For Apple TV, AI could improve content discovery by recommending shows based on viewing history and offering interactive features like real-time trivia.

Leveraging AI to enhance HomeKit's capabilities is essential, especially since HomeKit isn't a market leader in home automation. AI can offer smarter home automation by predicting user behavior to automate lights, thermostat settings, and security systems. 

Integrating AI across all devices ensures a seamless user experience. Preferences and data from one device would then inform recommendations on another, creating a unified ecosystem.

## How Apple wins the generative AI race

Apple's success in the AI race hinges on its ability to innovate and outperform competitors. By developing a clear on-device strategy, deploying AI-accelerated devices at the edge, and partnering with multiple AI and service providers, Apple can ensure comprehensive integration and enhanced user experiences. Emphasizing privacy, ethical AI development, and continuous innovation, Apple must leverage its ecosystem to provide seamless, personalized interactions across all products.

The [transition to Apple Silicon chips on the Mac](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/) at WWDC 2020 was a game-changer. The M1 significantly improved performance, power efficiency, and integration within Apple's ecosystem, giving the company greater control over its supply chain and product development. However, it didn't drastically transform the user experience, and the M4, while impressively powerful three generations onward, cannot transform the user experience solely on its specifications, either.
