 But this isn't always the case, as the AI tool might have problems understanding your request, you experience network issues, or your browser is affecting GhatGPT's functionality.

 If you've encountered the same issue while using ChatGPT, follow the steps below to fix it.

## 5\. Check Your Network Status

 If your internet is slow or you're having trouble connecting to OpenAI servers, ChatGPT may return an error instead of the wanted answer. However, according to ChatGPT, an internet speed of 5Mbps to 10Mbps should be enough to keep it running smoothly.

 You can test your internet speed online, and if it's a bit slow, you should pause large downloads or[switch from 2.4GHz to 5GHz](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-switch-from-24ghz-to-5ghz-in-windows-10/) .

## 6\. Clear Browser Cache

 There's a chance that your browser is to blame for ChatGPT showing the "error in body message." If ChatGPT identifies your questions or overall behavior as a potential threat, it will limit your benefits and actions. You could try apologizing, but there's no guarantee it will work.

 Instead,[clear your browser cache](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-cookies-cache-in-chrome/) to have a fresh start with ChatGPT. Also, you could try using a different browser or creating a new account to check if the problem persists.
