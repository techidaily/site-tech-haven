If you are an Apple device user and are interested in trying out a smartwatch for the first time, the Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) is the perfect smartwatch for you.

Figuring out which smartwatch to buy can be challenging with [so many options](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/) on the market. I recently went through the process of finding the perfect smartwatch for my boyfriend, so I can give you some insight into how I decided to buy this watch, which -- by the way -- was a smashing success.

It boiled down to two main points: Is he an Apple user, and what did he want the watch for?

If you -- or the person you're shopping for -- is an Apple user who needs a watch that fulfills basic functions like fitness tracking, heart-rate monitoring, sleep insights, and crash detection, and offers water resistance and a good battery, the Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) is a perfect fit.

The Apple Watch SE will be the most seamless smartwatch addition for an Apple user since its watchOS software mirrors iOS.

In addition, despite being the most budget-friendly model, the Apple Watch SE boasts many of the same health and safety features found in the more advanced Apple Watch models. In fact, the features it _doesn't_ have -- including blood oxygen tracking and temperature taking -- are ones that most first-time users would likely not need anyway.

When picking a screen size, I went with the 40mm, which happens to be the one on sale for $169, because I prefer to reduce the bulk of a wearable as much as possible, and I knew he would, too. I attached a photo of the watch on his wrist for perspective.

Apple products rarely go on sale, and a 32% discount can save you quite a bit of money. Since Amazon Prime Day is already over, I'd take advantage of the deal before it's gone.
