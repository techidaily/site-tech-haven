## Introducing the All-New Electric Escalade by Cadillac – An Impressive 450 Mile Journey Awaits

After months of [hints and teasers](https://www.reviewgeek.com/155632/cadillac-shares-a-first-glimpse-of-the-futuristic-escalade-ev/), General Motors has finally revealed the all-electric 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ. This is the first Escalade to get the EV treatment, and it's an absolute monster---not only does it use a 200kWh battery with a supposed 450-mile range (we're still waiting on an EPA estimate), but it packs a maximum 750 horsepower and 785 lb-ft of torque when in "Velocity Max" mode (which actually stays on, rather than acting as a momentary system). Clearly, GM understands that only a supercharged EV can replace the classic V8-powered Escalade.

 The Escalade IQ is also monstrously big, of course. Its wheelbase measures at 136.2 inches, and the overall length clocks in at 224.3 inches (that's 18.6 feet---about one foot longer than the gas-powered Escalade). To accommodate this new design, GM had to adjust the position of the Escalade's 24-inch wheels. It also gave a more dramatic slope to the Esclade IQ's windshield to retain its iconic long hood (which now serves as a roomy front trunk). Due to these changes, the car looks noticeably larger and sportier than gas-powered Escalade models.

 GM also went ham on the Escalade IQ's interior. A 55-inch infotainment screen runs across the entirety of the dashboard (though it's actually two screens put together), and a smaller 11-inch display rests in front of the center console. Evidently, all of the vehicle's controls are nestled in software, as there's a stunning lack of actual buttons and knobs. The infotainment system is powered by Qualcomm's [Snapdragon Digital Chassis Solution](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/08/snapdragon-digital-chassis-powers-2025-cadillac-escalade-iq--bri) platform, which enables hands-free driving, enhanced safety technology, and the Escalade IQ's automatic doors, among other features.

Close 

 As for actual useability, GM promises a 450-mile range, which greatly exceeds that of any Tesla. It typically produces 680 horsepower and 615 lb-ft of torque, though it can pump up to 750 horsepower and 785 lb-ft of torque in "Velocity Max" mode. Notably, this mode stays enabled until you turn off the vehicle. Other vehicles with a peak power mode usually rely on a momentary system, which disables itself just as you're starting to have fun. (The towing capacity is 8,000 pounds, which is what you'd expect from an Escalade.)

 Interestingly, GM claims that the Escalade IQ can achieve 100 miles of range after just 10 minutes of charging. But this requires a 350kW charging station. At home, where you'll probably use 19.2kW AC power, you can expect to gain about 35 miles of range for each hour of charging.

 The 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ will go on sale sometime next year. Pricing starts at $130,000 (about $15k more than the gas version), and to be clear, we're still waiting on an EPA range estimate. Note that GM has several EVs slated for 2023 and 2024, including an all-electric Chevy Equinox.
