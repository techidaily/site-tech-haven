 So, here are the best custom GPTs that actually make ChatGPT a better tool for any situation.

## 1 [Diagrams: Show Me](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-5QhhdsfDj-diagrams-show-me)

 The Diagrams: Show Me GPT plugin quickly visualizes all kinds of information in diagrams. You can use this add-on to view promotion paths at companies you want to work for, and it’s also handy if you need general flow charts (for example, we asked Diagrams: Show Me to outline the process from freelancing to running an agency).

 Once you’ve created an initial prototype, you can make adjustments by giving the GPT new instructions. Alternatively, you can edit the image with code instead if you know how to. You can use Diagrams: Show Me to[optimize productivity with workflow diagrams](https://www.makeuseof.com/optimize-productivity-with-workflow-diagram/) for your personal and work projects.

 When you use the Canva custom GPT, you may notice that some of the text in your visuals overlay other boxes. Fortunately, when you click on a design prototype, the GPT will redirect you to the Canva app. Here, you can make any edits you feel are necessary—such as resizing text and adding new images.

## 5 [Travel Guide](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-E7eSRUHy6-travel-guide)

 Do you have a big upcoming trip, or are you simply researching potential adventures? Consider using the Travel Guide GPT plugin to help you gather essential information and plan your itinerary.

 Travel Guide is pretty good at providing an itinerary outline for you to build upon later. For example, you can use the days it gives you and then do extra research elsewhere for places to eat, where to stay, etc.

 Academic research is a strenuous process regardless of your experience, but AI tools can help you streamline the process and provide more context. Scholar GPT is one of those. With this GPT, you can upload research paper PDFs and links to receive analysis.

![The Scholar GPT plugin analyzing a research paper](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-11-25-26.png)

## 9 [Gym, Fitness, & Training Assistant by Rogan Keel](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-QdyESXhOY-gym-fitness-exercise-training-assistant)

 Walking into the gym for the first time can be incredibly daunting, especially if you know little or nothing about fitness. Creating a program is also difficult; I still vividly remember spending hours on bodybuilding forums when I first began training in 2014\. Fortunately, getting the information you need is much easier these days—and Rogan Keel’s Gym, Fitness, & Training Assistant is a helpful custom GPT for new gym-goers.

 To use this GPT more effectively, make sure you give it as much information as possible. For example, I gave it my story of what my health condition was like when I first wanted to go to the gym and mentioned dietary requirements. You should also mention how many days you’d like to exercise per week. After giving the assistant all the required information, you’ll get an overview of your diet and exercise regimen.
