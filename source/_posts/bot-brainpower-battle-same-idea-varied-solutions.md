 You should now see the AIPRM dashboard on your ChatGPT page.

## How to Use the AIPRM for ChatGPT Chrome Extension

 To get started, go to your ChatGPT account. You should see the AIPRM dashboard on your homepage. Click the **thumbs-up or down** icon on the green popup that appears to dismiss it. You can now use the extension directly from your ChatGPT account.

![The AIPRM green popup in ChatGPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/aiprm-green-popup.jpeg)

 As you can see, there are several tabs in the AIPRM dashboard, including:

2. **AIPRM** to access the AIPRM Verified Prompts list. Note that this list is only accessible to premium subscribers.
3. **Public** to access the extensive selection of community prompts.
4. **Own** to access your custom prompts as well as those created by your team or anyone using that ChatGPT account.

![The AIPRM for ChatGPT dashboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/aiprm-chatgpt-dashboard.jpeg)

 You can start using AIPRM prompts by clicking the **Public** tab and scrolling through the list of available prompts. For instance, you can select the **Midjourney Prompt Generator** to get a detailed and descriptive prompt to generate a unique AI image. Type a keyword, and it will generate a detailed and descriptive prompt, which you can copy and paste into Midjourney.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## How to Filter and Favorite AIPRM Prompts

 Considering the extensive selection of prompts, finding the right one for your needs may be challenging or time-consuming. To make it easier to find a specific prompt, you can filter the prompts by topic, activity, popularity, or ChatGPT version.

 Click the **Topic** field to select topics like Marketing, productivity, or SEO. You can filter by **Activity** to find prompts suitable to specific activities or click **Sort by** to select prompts based on usage, views, or votes. Lastly, use the **Model** filter to choose a particular ChatGPT version. You can also use the **Search** bar to find prompts using keywords.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Once you have found a prompt that resonates with your needs, you can add it to your favorites for easy access in the future. Click the **Star** icon next to the prompt to add it to your **Favorites** tab. Next, go to the **Favorites** tab to view and access all your saved prompts.

## How to Create AIPRM Prompts

 Although thousands of prompts are available on AIPRM, you may sometimes need a more personalized prompt. So, why bother crafting your prompt in AIPRM rather than using it directly in ChatGPT? This can be useful when you need to reuse the prompt for a similar task in the future.

 To create a custom AIPRM prompt:

 First, click the **Own** tab on the main page. Next, click **Add Private Prompt**, and a new prompt template will appear.

 Next, fill out all the details of your prompt. Note that providing more detailed information in the **Prompt Template** field will increase your prompt's value and the response quality from ChatGPT. Let's say you wish to create a prompt to promote your business on Facebook. You can provide specific details like the name of your business, your services, your target audience, hashtags to use, and the tone of voice. In the same field, create the task by writing the instructions that ChatGPT will follow to generate the desired text.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 For instance, "Write a Facebook post with emojis and a call to action about **\[PROMPT\]**." Make sure to add the prompt variable **\[PROMPT\]** in your template, as it will be replaced by what you type whenever you use this prompt. In this example, the prompt variable **\[PROMPT\]** will be the topic for the Facebook post. You can also provide one or more examples of what you want the output to look like.

 Next, fill in the **Teaser** field. This is a description to help you remember the prompt easily. The **Prompt Hint** reminds you of what you will type in when using the prompt. This replaces the prompt variable **\[PROMPT\]**.

 Now, choose a **Title** for your prompt. This can be anything that will help you remember the purpose of the prompt.

 Lastly, select the **Topic**, **Activity**, **Who can see this?** and **Made for** (the ChatGPT model). Write your **Author Name** and **Author URL**. Click **Save Prompt** to finalize the creation of your prompt.

![AIPRM for ChatGPT prompt template creation page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/aiprm-prompt-template-creation.jpeg)

 Once your prompt is saved, you can find it under the **Own** tab.

 You have just created your first AIPRM prompt! Test it out and see what kind of response you get from ChatGPT. You can always edit your prompt by clicking the **pencil** icon next to it.

 AIPRM for ChatGPT is a handy productivity tool that can help you get relevant and quality responses from ChatGPT. Its vast library of expertly crafted prompts makes it easier to interact with ChatGPT and get the desired output.
