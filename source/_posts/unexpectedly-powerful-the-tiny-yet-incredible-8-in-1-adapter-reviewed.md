While a couple of USB-C ports is all I need most of the time, it's nice to have access to more when you really need it. Whether that be an HDMI port, Ethernet, or an SD card reader, this 8-in-1 USB-C multiport adapter has you covered. 

This adapter, like everything else Satechi makes, oozes an Apple-style design aesthetic with rugged practicality. It is a beautifully crafted adapter, and quite portable: it's just as at home on a desk as it is on the road. The aluminum and plastic construction is not only tough but also dissipates the heat generated by the adapter when in use.

And it works well.

Ports galore!

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

After several weeks of solid use, my adapter still looks like new. And the adapter stays cool to the touch even when the dock is pushed to its limits.

And while Satechi is best known as a manufacturer of accessories for the Apple ecosystem, this adapter will work on all sorts of devices, from MacBooks, iPads, and iMacs, to devices such as the Lenovo Yoga, Microsoft Surface, Google PixelBook Go, and even the Steam Deck. Simply put, these adapters are exceedingly versatile.

As I expect from a Satechi product, this dock lives up to everything listed on the spec sheet, with all the ports delivering the promised performance. I've filled it up with connections, ran it for an extended period of time, and the dock performed flawlessly.

There's even an Ethernet port!

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

One thing to bear in mind about this adapter is that it's a modern design, and as such doesn't have what we now considered to be legacy ports such as USB-A and 3.5mm headphones jack. If you need those, there are [other adapters that are better suited](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-ultimate-laptop-accessory-the-satechi-usb-4-multiport-adapter/) to your needs. But if you can do without these ports, this is as close to being a perfect adapter as you can get.
