### 1\. What is an ACSM File

First of all, you need to know what an acsm file is before downloading Google Play Book to your computer. Because the majority of the books you download from Google Play website are acsm files instead of PDFs or ePub books. So it's very necessary to explain what is an acsm file.

An ACSM file (Adobe Content Server Message) is a file format used by Adobe Digital Editions to digitally distribute eBooks protected by Adobe's DRM system. When you purchase an eBook from an online store, instead of directly downloading the actual eBook file, you often receive an ACSM file. This file contains information such as the book's title, author, ISBN, and a link to download the actual eBook content from Adobe's servers. When you open an ACSM file with ADE, the software contacts Adobe's servers, verifies your purchase, and then downloads the encrypted eBook file to your device. 

It's important to note that an ACSM file can only be opened using the Adobe Digital Editions ID you've configured. Once opened, you can access the book content on any device running ADE with the same user ID, eliminating the need for repurchasing.

### 2\. How to Download Google Play Books to Your Computer 

Google Play Books is an ebook digital distribution service operated by Google. Users can purchase and download ebooks and audiobooks from Google Play, which offers over five million titles, with Google claiming it to be "the largest ebooks collection in the world". Books can be read on a dedicated Books section on the Google Play website, through the use of a mobile app available for Android and iOS, through the use of select e-readers that offer support for Adobe Digital Editions or through a web browser. But you must download the Epubor PDF book from the Google Play website to your computer in order to read it on ADE. 

Step 1Download [Adobe Digital Editions](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html) to your computer and authorize it with an Adobe ID. 

Run adobe digital editions, click **Help** in the menu bar > **Authorize Computer** with Adobe ID. If you have an Adobe ID already, you can just input your Adobe ID and password to authorize it. If you don't have one, then you need to create an Adobe ID to authorize it.

Step 2Export Google Play Books to Your Computer.

Access your library by navigating to <https://play.google.com/books> using your computer's web browser. Ensure that you are logged in to view your owned books.

![google book download option](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/google-book-download-option.png)

Then find ebook title you want to download, click the three dots icon on the bottom-right corner of the ebook cover. Next, select **Export > Export ACSM for EPUB or Export ACSM for PDF** from the popup menu to start downloading the book.

![download googleplay book](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/drm-google-acsm.png)

Step 3Open .acsm File with Adobe Digital Editions (ADE). 

You will get a **.acsm** file instead of a Epub or PDF file directly. So you need to double click the .acsm file, then ADE will download the book automatically. After downloading the book to your computer, you can open and read it in Adobe Digital Editions.

![download acsm via ade](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/download-acsm-via-ade.png)

**1\. When exporting ACSM for EPUB/PDF from your Google Play Books library, you will receive a .acsm link. Simply double-click the link to initiate the content download through ADE.**

**2\. Please be aware that not all Google Play Books are exportable in ACSM format. Many Google Books are DRM-free and can be directly exported as EPUB or PDF files.**

I dod not have an Adobe account, nor do I wish to create one. I downloaded my google play ebooks direct from google and this tutorial (and the software in general) was absolutely unhelpful in making them readable. I would give 0 stars if I could.

Weird question:  
 How does ADE "know" which Google account to authorize the ebooks to?  
 I logged in with an Adobe ID that has no connection to my Google account.  
 Download the ACSM and it open just fine in ADE  
 Then I can transfer it to calibre without stripping the DRM! I can even convert to TXT and other formats.  
 Furthermore, I logged out of ADE and it won't open the ebooks, but if I go to explorer I can open the epub in Calibre and convert it and read it etc.

 What's going on here? This is driving me mad!

Thank you for contacting us.  
 1\. The .acsm file is the link to download the google play books. So if you authorize the adobe digital editions with your adobe id, it will help you download the acsm file to epub/pdf.   
 2\. Some downloaded epub are encrypted pdf/epub are encrypted with drm and some are not.  
 3\. If you've already install the calibre drm removal plugin, when you add the google books to calibre, the drm will be removed automatically. That's why you can convert them to other format.

Bait and switch. To get it to download a full pdf you will be instructed to pay for a full license of the software -- it is misleading that the article claims you can do this with a free edition of the software.

 "Your ebook has decrypted. The file just save 20% of ebook content. Please register the software, then get full content and the valid ebook format."

Useless for google play. Price for 1 book would be more appropriate.

How do you pull books from Google Play books that do not have the "export" button, some of mine do, some of mine don't. It's those that I want access to but nowhere seems to have a solution to obtain these sorts of files.
