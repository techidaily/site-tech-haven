![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_5949dc1ab0110.png)

 Batch file is a computer file containing a list of instructions to be carried out in turn.

 For example, you need to constantly run several commands to refresh your network settings, and repeating the same procedure over and over again could be time consuming. Or there are a number of websites that you need to open in order to work, and it could be annoying to have to open them one by one every time. A batch file can help you solve the headache.

 In this post, we will show you how to easily create your own batch file to make things so much easier!

 Basically, you just need to do the following things to create a batch file that automatically runs the commands:

 1) Open a**Notepad** , or a**Notepad++** document, but not a Word document;

 2) Bear in mind basic commands:

**echo:** The**ON** or**OFF** option for ECHO turns the echoing feature on or off. If the ECHO is on, the CMD will display the command executing.

**pause: S** **top** the running of Windows batch file;

**start “” \[website\]** : Go to website using your default browser.

 3) Save your file with the file extension**.bat** ;

 4) Double click to run the batch file and right click and choose**Edit** for further edit.

 As mentioned above, a batch file can help you troubleshoot frequent**network issue** . You may be aware that you need to type in_**ipconfig**_ and some other commands to run the troubleshoot, but you don’t have to do it again and again whenever you have network issues. Let’s see how a batch file helps you with that!

 1) Right click on a blank space on your desktop and select**New** , and then choose**Text Document** from the list.

 2) Double click to open the text document. Then type in the following commands:

**ECHO OFF**
**ipconfig**
**ipconfig /flushdns**  
**ping google.com**  
**tracert google.com**  
**PAUSE**

 When you finish typing the commands, choose**Save as…** and then changed the file name to a name ends with**.bat** (**we go with network\_diagnose.bat** ) and sve the file type as**All Files** . Then hit**Save** button.

**NOTE** : There are many more commands in Windows that you can create a batch file with. If you need, just look for them in search engine and repeat the above procedure to create a batch file fast and easily!

 Another handy usage of batch file is that it opens your favored websites all at once when you run it. Here is how you do it:

 1) Right click on a blank space on your desktop and select**New** , and then choose**Text Document** from the list.
