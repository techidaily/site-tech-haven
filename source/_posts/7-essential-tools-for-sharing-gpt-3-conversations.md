### Key Takeaways

* Layla, Wonderplan, and PLAN by ixigo are AI travel planning apps with customizable itineraries.
* iplan.ai offers detailed itineraries for popular tourist cities based on interests and budget.
* Curiosio plans road trips on all continents, while Trip Planner AI helps with activity selection and cost estimation.

 You can tell a travel agent your preferred dates, the place you want to visit, and your budget, and expect a full itinerary of what to do there based on your preferences. But can AI do the same job?

 These free travel planning apps use AI and machine-learning tools like ChatGPT to prepare an itinerary for you in a few seconds, and we took them for a spin.

## 1.[Layla](https://justasklayla.com/)

![layla ai trip planner](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/layla-ai-trip-planner.png)

 Layla describes itself as an AI trip planner, meaning you can use it to decide your vacation destination, create itineraries, and find suitable hotels and flights.

 If you are uncertain about your destination or would like suggestions, you can ask Layla for advice regarding your trip. Otherwise, enter your destination and ask Layla to create your itinerary. Within a few seconds, you'll get a detailed plan for your trip.

 As Layla is a chatbot, you can enter a prompt to ask it to change your itinerary. For instance, ask it to focus more on outdoor activities or include local restaurants. If you're unsatisfied with the activities planned on any particular day, you can give instructions and ask Layla to regenerate that part only.

 Once you've perfected your itinerary, you can share it with your friends via a URL or add it to your bucket list.

## 2.[Wonderplan](https://wonderplan.ai/)

![wonderplan website screenshot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wonderplan-screenshot.jpg)

 Wonderplan is a wonderful AI tool for planning your trip. To create your itinerary, Wonderplan first asks you to enter your destination country and city, your budget, the number of days you'll be staying, and your interests.

 It then creates a travel plan within a few minutes, displaying various places to visit, their descriptions, and the time usually spent at each location. Although Wonderplan doesn't show the trip map, it does provide a link to Google Maps for each place.

 It also displays different types of accommodation available (like Airbnb, hotel, or hostel) and their respective costs. Similarly, there are details about transportation, food, and activities. This way, you can estimate the potential cost of your trip.

 In addition to your itinerary, Wonderplan also shows essential information about the country you're visiting. These include the currency conversion rate, electricity plug type, languages spoken, weather, and popular conveyances.

![PLAN by ixigo website screenshot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/plan-by-ixigo-screenshot.jpg)

 PLAN by ixigo starts by asking you about your dream destination. Then, it provides an option to describe the type of experience you want to have. This is just like a ChatGPT prompt, so you can enter anything you wish.

 For example, you can specify the duration of your stay, your interests, the kinds of activities you're looking for, whether you have a family with you, and so on.

 But if you can't think of any prompts, PLAN by ixigo provides a few trip ideas, so you can always select those. PLAN by ixigo then shows a day-wise plan, showing what you can do in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

 However, if the suggested itinerary doesn't sound appealing, you can again enter a prompt to edit it.

## 4.[iplan.ai](https://iplan.ai/)

 While iplan.ai doesn't mention which AI or machine-learning algorithm it uses, the results are fantastic enough to gloss over that. The app works beautifully on phones to give you a full itinerary for any one city at a time, depending on how many days you have there.

 The app first asks you to name the destination city. As far as we checked, iplan.ai works best for popular tourist cities, not offbeat or obscure travel. Next, note how many days you will be there, and then choose your free time each day—a cool step to ensure a better itinerary if you already have some plans, but not a whole days worth.

 Tell iplan.ai if you're traveling solo, as a couple, with family, or with friends, and then choose your interest among topics like history, art and culture, nature, entertainment, shopping, food, sports, relaxing, etc. Finally, choose between an economy, normal, or luxury budget.

 After a few minutes, iplan.ai gives you a day-wise itinerary for your trip. It's plotted on a map so you can see all the locations, and each point of interest has a brief description along with estimated travel time.

 The app has both free and paid plans. With a paid account, you can share the trip plan with your friends and access it offline. Another limitation of iplan.ai is that you can't get an itinerary for a multi-city trip. For now, you'll need to make a plan for each city you're visiting, one at a time.

**Download:** iplan.ai for[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2021804/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.iplan.app) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/iplan-ai-travel-planner/id1611716564) (Free, Paid)

![Curiosio is a roadtrip planning app based on AI that gives you several parameters to refine your journey before plotting a route based on your interests](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/travel-planning-ai-apps-generate-itinerary-curiosio.jpg)

 The easiest last-minute travel plan is to get into a car and drive. Curiosio specializes in helping you plan an itinerary for a road trip to several major countries on all continents. It doesn't cover every single place, but the existing collection is impressive enough.

 Curiosio uses its own AI engine, Ingeenee, which is trained on several crowdsourced travel-based resources, such as Wikivoyage, Wikipedia, Wikidata, Freebase, DBpedia, GeoNames, OSMNames, and OpenStreetMap. Through this dataset, it can chart an itinerary that meets your requirements across various parameters.

 You can set options for a round trip or a one-way trip with starting and finishing points. If there are any places you want to visit on the way, add them in. Then set the number of travelers, dates of the journey, what vehicle you're using, total budget, and whether you want to visit places that spark curiosity or are obscure. The AI will usually give you multiple plans and routes for these options.

 The itinerary includes a map of your route and a day-wise breakdown of where you'll be going and what you'll be seeing. Each point of interest is clickable to find more information about it. There are easy ways to share your itinerary with co-travelers, print it out, or even export it to Google Maps. Curiosio is one of the[best road trip planners for your next adventure](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/road-trip-planners/) .

## 6.[Trip Planner AI](https://tripplanner.ai/)

![trip planner ai screenshot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trip-planner-ai-screenshot.png)

 Trip Planner AI plans a perfect trip to your dream destination. Begin creating your itinerary by entering the city you wish to visit and traveling dates. You can add multiple destinations here.

 Then, select the kinds of activities you prefer, the number of people, and whether you're traveling with friends or family. Trip Planner AI asks you about your dietary preferences and budget.

 As an optional step, you can specify the place where you'll be staying so that it creates an itinerary accordingly. If you haven't decided on your lodging yet, you can explore hotels suggested by Trip Planner AI.

 Finally, Trip Planner AI generates a detailed itinerary, a map, and basic information about the city you're visiting. For each destination, it provides the details of the place, expected traveling time, and cost. Though it provides a complete plan for your trip, you can manually add or remove activities from your itinerary. You can also invite your friends to edit the itinerary and download it as a PDF.

## 7.[Vacay Chatbot](https://www.usevacay.com/chatbot)

![vacay chatbot screenshot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/vacay-chatbot-screenshot.png)

 Vacay Chatbot is not a dedicated itinerary maker but an AI chatbot that acts like your travel advisor. So, you can ask it to give travel recommendations, compare different destinations, and, of course, create an itinerary. If you've previously used AI chatbots like ChatGPT, you'll find this trip planner easy to use.

 Just enter a prompt specifying your destination and trip details and ask Vacay Chatbot to create an itinerary. You can include details like your trip duration, budget, preferences, number of travelers, etc. The more details you provide, the better your itinerary will be.

 One of the downsides of using Vacay Chatbot is that it doesn't provide a map for your trip. However, you can use these[apps to plot your itinerary on a map](https://www.makeuseof.com/travel-planning-apps-live-maps-trip-itinerary/) .

 All these travel planning AI apps urge you not to use the itinerary as-is and only treat it as a template or guide to begin planning your trip. This is because they currently have several limitations, like databases that aren't recently updated or require specific prompts from the user.

 A real human travel agent will still give you a more customized itinerary, but it will cost you a few bucks. If you want a free base guide, more basic[travel planning apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/group-travel-planning-apps/) are a good starting point.
