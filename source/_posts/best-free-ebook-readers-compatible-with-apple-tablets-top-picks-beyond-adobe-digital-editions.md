We all konw that Adobe Digital Editions is a good ebook reader and management to open epub and pdf books on computer. We can even say that we can read any adobe books on computer with ADE.

But if you do not like Adobe Digtial Editions because its slow speed, you may ask me how can I read adobe books on iPad, is there any adobe digital editions alternatives for iPad, etc. Don't worry this article will solve your problems step by step.

### Adobe Ditital Editions alternatives for iPad

Though Adobe doesn't provide us ADE for iPad, but "All roads lead to Roam", since we cann't read adobe books on iPad with ADE, why not find some ade alternatives? If there were some good alternatives that take the same role, we can use them to read adobe epub & pdf books on iPad, iPhone, iPod.

Here I list **some good adobe digital editions alternatives for iPad**, so that you can read ADE content.

#### 1\. Bluefire Reader

![bluefire reader alternative](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/bluefire-reader.jpg)

One of the best alternatives to read Adobe Content Server protected ebooks on your iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. You can read EPUB and PDF eBooks from retailers, publishers, online ebook sellers all around the world, no matter they are drm free or DRM protected.

Bluefire is easy to work with, after you get it downloaded, next time you find some books you loved, you will have the option of opening it directly into this alternative app. The ability to adjust the screen brightness by swiping up or down is highly praised among people.

Official site: [Bluefire Productions Web Site](http://www.bluefirereader.com/)

Price: Free

#### 2\. txtr

![txtr alternative](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/txtr.jpg)

Another good app for you to read adobe books on iPad, replacing ADE. You can read your books with a selection, and you can also find and collect some good ebooks with txtr feed, share them with other users.

But txtr requires a different method to get content onto your iPad. Firstly you should login to their website (you'd better log with your Adobe ID), then upload your books. Job hasn't finished yet, you have to get your txtr app started, then download the files. It would take you some time to load book files, so if you choose this app, be a little patient please. One good point of using txtr is that is available for Android devices as well as IOS. So if you own an iPad, and also use an android smart phone, txtr is a good choice, isn't it?

Price: Free

These are the best 2 alternatives I recommend in today's post. Both bluefire and txtr support full-text searching, bookmarks adding by clicking in the upper right corner. 

Now the problem 1 you concerned have been resolved. Just with a trial on whichever apps you will earn a good reading. The left let's spend time talking about **how to read adobe books on iPad**.

### How to read adobe books on iPad

You may have discovered that after you get some books with adobe format, transfer them to iPad, usually you will get a message like "can't open. It is formatted incorrectly, or is not a format that iBooks can open". Why?

#### The problem of adobe ebooks-Adobe DRM

What is Adobe DRM? In common, adobe books we purchased from Sony, Kobo, some online libraries are protected with Adobe DRM, produced by Adobe. It's made for preventing from unauthorized use. Adobe Digital Editions can open these DRMed files without limitation.

#### How to deal with

As we have discussed the problem of adobe content, you may have known the reason why we couldn't't read adobe files on iPad directly.

Now here comes to the method how to read.

Method 1: Accetp drm--use adobe digital editions for iPad alternative

Since ADE is not provided on iPad, and those drm adobe files can only open with ade, so we can choose an alternative to replace ade to read them. For [how to](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/), back to part 1 please.

Method 2: Remove drm--remove drm from adobe ditital editions

If you still don't like the alternatives I recommend above, or you want to use built-in reading app iBooks to read adobe books on iPad, removing drm is another good choice. Let your book files be released, available to transfer, share with friends.

Thanks so much for your research and clear explanations. Using Bluefire reader solved my problem on the first try! I was hoping to read my document on my Kobo app., on my iPad. Do you know anything about that? Thanks again!

Hi Astrid,

 It's shame that the Kobo app doesn't allow self-uploaded eBooks.

 You can only use it to read the books bought from Kobo store.
