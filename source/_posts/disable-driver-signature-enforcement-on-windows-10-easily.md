 **Option One: Meter your Internet connection**
  
 Using a metered Internet connection is the easiest way to prevent Windows 10 from installing or getting the updates automatically.
  
 If you are connecting to the Internet via**wireless connection** , here is how you can meter your Internet connection.
  
 1) Follow the step: **Start button > Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi** . On the right side of the pane, click the name of your Wi-Fi connection.

 If you are connecting to the Internet via Ethernet, Windows 10 seems to assume that you have unlimited data usage. But if you want to update Windows 10 at your own pace, meaning that you manually download an update on a metered connection. Here is how you can do it.
  
 Follow the step: **Start button > Settings > Update & security > Windows Update** . Then**Check for updates** .

 If found any, just press the**Download** button to get them downloaded and installed.
  
 If you want to change the setting so that even when you are using Ethernet Windows 10 will not update automatically, you need to delve into the Registry Editor to make some changes. But messing around with your Registry could break your computer. So we do not recommend you do that here.
  
 **Option Two: Disable automatic driver updates**
  
 1) Click the**Start** button and then choose**Control Panel** (View by**Small icon** ). Then go to**System** .
