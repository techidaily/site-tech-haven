![](http://www.epubor.com/images/faq.png) Frequently Asked Questions on Kindle Family Sharing

##### Q: Are purchased kindle books automatically shared between two adult accounts in the family library? For some books, I don't want to share them with my friend or family.

A: If any of you has purchased any book or audiobook, it will be shared automatically. Both of you can read or listen to it. Of course, you can pick up which book you want to share with others or not. Just go to "**Manage my Kindle Content and device**". Click on three dots before your purchased book, and then click on " Manage Family Library" and then click on "**Add to Library**". Your picked Kindle books will be shared with your family.  
![share picked books](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/share-individual-kindle books-family-library.png) 

##### Q: Can both adults sharing the family library have access to the book during the same time period? For example, adult A reads the book from 3 - 4:00 PM, and adult B reads the same book on a different device from 7 - 8:00 PM of the same day?

A: If you are using the same account on Amazon, or otherwise sharing the book electronically, you should be able to read the book on both devices. Unfortunately, if you are on the same account, it may sync your reading progress onto both devices if you are reading at the same time, so you may have to set a bookmark after you read.

##### Q: How to stop sharing Kindle library?

A: Yes, you can stop sharing your kindle audiobooks, ebook or apps. The setting to have All books Automatically shared is defaulted to **ON.** If you don't want that, turn that setting **OFF** in [Content and Devices](https://www.amazon.com/myh/manage?ref%5F=hh%5Fmycd%5Fmyh%5Fmanage). You can then pick and chose which of your books will be included in the Family Library list.   
![stop sharing kindle books](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/stop-sharing.png)  
 If you have some specific book that don't want to share with your family member's, you can just go to [Content and Devices](https://www.amazon.com/myh/manage?ref%5F=hh%5Fmycd%5Fmyh%5Fmanage), click the "More action" next to the title you don’t want to share, choose “Manage Family Library” and when the names of everyone in your Household pop up, just click “Remove From Library”.

##### Q: Can I share Kindle unlimited books with my family?

A: Yes, the Amazon Household allows you to share your Kindle library, including Kindle Unlimited, between two accounts. It is important to note that sharing Kindle Unlimited doesn't mean unlimited reading. Only one person can access and read the same title from Kindle Unlimited at a time.

###  How to Share Kindle Books without Family Library (5 Methods)

What if the person you want to share books with is not a member of your Kindle Family Library? Besides Kindle Family households, there are still many other methods that you can follow to share your Kindle books. In the follow part, I will share 5 methods of sharing kindle books without kindle family households.

#### Method 1: Kinde Account Sharing

Amazon enables you to access your Kindle library on up to 6 devices, including Kindle e-ink devices, Kindle desktop, Kindle Tablets, Kindle for Android/iOS. Thanks to this policy, you can share your Kindle account information with friends so that they can register their Kindle devices or reading app with your kindle login credential. 

##### Limits of sharing kindle accounts

* 1\. You may have already registered your Kindle account on up to 6 devices or apps.
* 2\. Amazon account information is private and personal. Once someone has logged into your Amazon account, they will have full access to all your purchased eBooks, not just the one you want to share. Furthermore, your Amazon account information, including purchase history and payment details, will be exposed to others.
* 3\. Furthermore, if you have set up 1-click payment, others will have the opportunity to make purchases using your Amazon account credentials.

#### Method 2: Can a Kindle Book Be Shared? Yes, Lend a Kindle Book. 

Updated: Amazon hasn’t made an official announcement, but I've noticed that the 'Load this title' option has disappeared from all of my purchased Kindle books. So, I assume this method will not work anymore.

**Can I lend my kindle books to another kindle user?**Sure, you can lend Kindle books to your family or friends. However, I want to clarify all limitations for lending and borrowing before you take any further action.

##### Limits of lending kindle books are listed as below.

* 1\. You can lend a Kindle book to another person for up to **14 days**.
* 2\. The borrower does not need to own a kindle device to read the Kindle books, but can read the book after downloading a free Kindle reading app.
* 3\. A book can only be loaned once.
* 4\. Magazines and newspapers are currently not available for lending.
* 5\. You are not able to read the book you loaned in the loaning period.
* 6\. Not all Kindle books can be loaned. It depends on the publisher.
* 7\. This "Loan" option is only available in USA currently.

 After learning about the limitations of lending Kindle books, do you still want to lend out your Kindle books? If yes, the following guide will walk you through the whole process.

#####  Steps for lending Kindle books to others

**Step 1.** To loan a book, visit "[Manage your Content and Devices](https://www.amazon.com/mycd)" at Amazon.com.

Then “**Loan this book**” page will pop up and enter your friend’s email address to “**Recipient E-mail address**”. Then click on” **Send now**” to send out the notification. 

![enter recipient email address](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/enter-receipient-email.png)

#### Method 3: How can I share a book on kindle? -- Lend Kindle eReader to Others

However, you can still [**read kindle book on Kindle apps**](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) that registered with your Kindle account.

#### Method 4: Share Kindle Books via "Buy for Others"

Recently, Amazon has released a new feature--buying Kindle books for others. If you want to share Kindle books with your friend, just purchase a copy for him.

Step 1  Go to Kindle books's product detail page on Amazon as below. You will see "**Buy for others**" section at the right corner as below picture.

![buy for others](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/buy-for-others.png)

Step 2  Select the quantity you want to buy and provide your order details, then click "**place your order**" button to finish the order. If you only buy single copy, Amazon will email the book to the recipient on your behalf. If you purchase multiple copies, please send redemption links to your recipients.

 It will cost extra money to purchase a new book if you choose to buy for others.

Method 1: Use the same Kindle account to sync your books and download them.

 Method 2: Remove DRM from your Kindle books, and then transfer those drm-free files to your other Kindle. This is also a good method to back up your Kindle contents.

I would like to lend someone my kindle-ebook (not the book, the hardware) and have access to just one or two books out of my complete collection. He should not be able to see all my other books or access to them, just the few selected books. Is that possible?

 My idea was to create a family-account and this person should get either the second adult account or a child account. But after that, can I, the from my main adult-account select singular books this person should have access to?

 Thanks a lot,

I think you can creator a child account and share the selected books with this new account. Then register your software with this new account. The one borrowed your hardware only can see the book you want to share with the child account.

One step to add before step 6\. Each Amazon account allows up to 6 devices to be registered. By signing into your own Amazon account using friend's ereader tablet or computer. This option gives primary user to send selected books to friends or family member without exhange of sharing wallets or limits to lending. Surprisingly, only on Guardian website, in the UK thinks breaking bank laws on Amazon is questionable for family sharing. It does seem intrusive and not clear why the options are not simpler. Such as, when lending in a public library. They do not ruin the book after one lend, but that is what happens with Amazon's lending. After one lend, your book is useless. So if you wish for a parent & sibling to check out a specific book. Only one person can look at it. One of them will have to find a copy or sample elsewhere. For me, it's like destroying your copy after one lend. Which library in the world does that?
