As an Apple user, I've found that product longevity is one of my biggest feature priorities. Though I upgrade to a new phone every three to four years, I still use my 8th-generation iPad daily, love my 2019 iMac, and always wear my Apple Watch 7\. 

However, with new iOS, iPadOS, MacOS, and [WatchOS](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-apple-watch-is-getting-an-upgrade-here-are-the-coolest-features-in-watchos-11/) being showcased at WWDC this past June and new features announced today during Apple's iPhone event, you may wonder about your device's compatibility with Apple's latest software versions.

WatchOS 11 is expected to roll out on Monday, September 16, but you can [download the beta now](https://www.zdnet.com/article/you-can-download-watchos-11-beta-on-your-apple-watch-right-now-heres-how-and-supported-models/). 

New software updates come with compatibility lists that often exclude older devices. Here's the list of supported Apple Watch models for the latest version of WatchOS 11, which includes new fitness and health features.

## Which Apple Watch models will not support WatchOS 11?

With the release of WatchOS 11, Apple stopped supporting software updates for several Apple Watch models. Here are the Apple Watch models that will _not_ get WatchOS 11:

* Apple Watch Series 5 (2019)
* Apple Watch Series 4 (2018) and older
* Apple Watch SE (2020)

This list only includes the first-generation Apple Watch SE, launched in 2020; the 2022 Apple Watch SE is expected to support WatchOS 11.

Apple typically drops software support for older Apple Watch and devices with hardware limitations to focus and streamline the development process of newer models. Of course, this is also part of tech giants' market strategy, as it motivates users to buy new devices.
