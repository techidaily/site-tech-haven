 Here are 4 fixes for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.

 **Method 1:[Check Skype Heartbeat](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 2:[Upgrade Skype to the latest version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 **Method 5:[Update Network Card Driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1\. Check Skype Heartbeat

 If Skype is suddenly down, most of the case, the problem is not on your side. It could be Skype that is having issues. You can check Skype’s status by:

 1) Open Skype. Click**Help** , then**Heartbeat** .
