## 3\. Reload the Page

 A browser or system glitch might be the reason why ChatGPT is showing the "error in body stream" message. First, try reloading the page to reconnect it to OpenAI servers.

 Additionally, you could restart your browser or switch to a different one.

## 4\. Writer Shorter Requests

 If you ask ChatGPT to answer too many things at once, it might give you the body stream error instead of the desired answer. Instead, try to write shorter prompts, so it can identify what you need to know.

 Even if you want to[use ChatGPT as a language translation tool](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-translate-with-chatgpt/) , you might run into issues if you hand it too much to handle at once.

You can even ask to generate a response at a preferred level of complexity to[get the best results from ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-get-best-results-from-chatgpt/) .

## 5\. Check Your Network Status

 If your internet is slow or you're having trouble connecting to OpenAI servers, ChatGPT may return an error instead of the wanted answer. However, according to ChatGPT, an internet speed of 5Mbps to 10Mbps should be enough to keep it running smoothly.

## 6\. Clear Browser Cache

 There's a chance that your browser is to blame for ChatGPT showing the "error in body message." If ChatGPT identifies your questions or overall behavior as a potential threat, it will limit your benefits and actions. You could try apologizing, but there's no guarantee it will work.

 Instead,[clear your browser cache](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-cookies-cache-in-chrome/) to have a fresh start with ChatGPT. Also, you could try using a different browser or creating a new account to check if the problem persists.
