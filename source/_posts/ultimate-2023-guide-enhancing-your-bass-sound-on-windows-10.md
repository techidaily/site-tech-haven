 Before getting to use a computer with Windows 10 operating system installed, you are required to select the default language for your PC. But if you prefer to use a different language, you can change it any time you want. This is particularly helpful if you are sharing your PC with other users who prefer different languages. To change the system language, you can follow the steps below to get it done fast and easily!
  
**Note** : You are required to signed into Windows 10 and use an administrative account to proceed.
  
**1: Install a language**
  
 1) Hit **Windows** key, then choose**Settings** from the**Start** panel. In the Settings window, choose**Time & language** option.
