I agree with your placement of Calibre as Number One. I've used it since Windows XP and love it, but unfortunately he's decided he needs to add some features that Windows 7 does not support, so current versions do not work on Windows 7\. I don't suppose there are many of us still holding on, but I will not upgrade, and I'm not ready to make the switch to Linux yet so I need to find something else.
