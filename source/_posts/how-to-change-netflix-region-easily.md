## Revamp Your Streaming Experience: Changing Netflix Regions Made Easy

Netflix isn’t a service that’s available to everyone, everywhere. If Netflix is blocked in your country, you won’t be able to access it to watch movies, TV shows, etc.

 In addition, Netflix catalogs vary depending on where you are. For example, if you’re in the UK, you’re not able to watch the content that’s only available in the USA. This is because of different licensing agreements between content owners and Netflix, meaning video owners choose to display the content only to particular countries. Or Netflix simply blocks the video to comply with local laws.

 Luckily, you still can watch any content you want on Netflix. The method is to change the region on Netflix. In this article, we’ll show you how to change Netflix region/country.

### Why use a VPN to change Netflix region?

 The only way to change Netflix region is to change your IP address to another IP address from other countries. The best choice to change IP address is to use a VPN. VPN is short for Virtual Private Network. **A VPN can mask your IP address and replace it with another IP address from other countries** . So a VPN can make it look like you’re connecting to the websites like Netflix from other countries.

 With a VPN, **you can connect to the server in the country that provides the Netflix content you want** . For example, if you’re travelling in Spanish, you wish to watch some USA movies, then you can use the VPN to choose the server in USA. After that, you can watch any movie that’s available in USA.

 In addition, VPN builds an encrypted tunnel between your computer and the VPN server. **When you use a VPN to access a website, the traffic between your computer and the destination website is encrypted** . This prevents others like the hackers and your ISP (Internet Service Provide) tracking your information. In this case, they won’t know who you’re and what you did on the internet. With a VPN, you can expect privacy and security while surfing the internet and accessing the content you like on Netflix.

### VPNs for Netflix that still work

 There are many VPNs out there you can choose from. But not all VPNs work with Netftlix. In recent years, Netflix has used their specific rules to verify the IP addresses that belong to VPNs. Once they detect the IP address is from a VPN, they will block that IP address or block all IP addresses from that VPN. If you use a VPN that doesn’t work with Netflix, you will receive a proxy error message like this:

 “Whoops, something went wrong. Streaming error. You seem to be using an unblocker or proxy. Please turn off any of these services and try again.”

 **To change Netflix region successfully, you need to find a VPN that still works with Netflix.**

 As we mentioned above, there are so many VPNs for you to choose from. It will take time if you want to find a VPN which can bypass Netflix detection. It’s even harder to find a trustworthy VPN.

## Other ways to change Netflix region?

 Some visitors are wondering if there are other ways to change Netflix region. The answer is Yes. You can choose to use other ways to change Netflix region if you don’t want to use a VPN. The other way is to use**DNS proxy** .

 We recommend VPN but not DNS proxy, as the latter is less reliable. Most DNS proxies cannot bypass Netflix detection. Your IP address can be blocked easily. In addition, DNS proxy doesn’t encrypt your traffic. Without encryption, the ISP and hackers can track your online activity. Your personal information can be stolen. Though DNS proxy is free, we do not recommend it.
