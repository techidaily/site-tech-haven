## Why is Fortnite blocked at school?

 Many schools use firewalls to block Fortnite because they think Fortnite can be a distraction from studying. They want their students to focus on their studies. In addition, playing Fortnite requires a huge amount of bandwidth. Schools don’t want to spend money on the bandwidth caused by playing games.

 School IT administrators block Fortnite through the entire school network. If you use the school Wi-Fi to play Fortnite, no matter what devices you use, you can’t bypass the restriction.

**Can I use my cellular data to play Fortnite?** The answer is definitely Yes. But note that playing Fortnite requires fast internet and a huge amount of bandwidth. If you use your cellular data to play Fortnite, you can have a hefty phone bill. Though you have unlimited data each month, your carrier will charge you more if you’re using too much data. So it’s not recommended you use cellular data. Read on to find how to unblock Fortnite at school.

## How to unblock Fortnite at school

 The best way we recommend to unblock Fortnite is to use a Chrome extension or a VPN. To unblock Fortnite, you need to bypass the network restriction in school. To get that, you can mask your IP address. A Chrome extension or a VPN can allow you to mask your IP address and make it appear that you’re in a different location.

### Unblock Fortnite at school using a VPN

 VPN is short for virtual private network. It allows you to connect to the server located outside your country. It hides your IP address and makes it appear that you’re in a different location. When you use a VPN to surf, others like your school administrators, and the ISP (Internet Server Provider) are not able to track you. In this way, you can surf online safely. With a VPN, you’ll be able to play Fortnite on PC from your school, abroad, or anywhere in the world.

 In addition, VPN provides fast internet speed. Playing Fortnite requires a fast internet. With a VPN, when you’re playing Fortnite, you don’t need to worry about interruptions caused by poor internet speed.

 There are many VPNs you can choose from. Some are free, and some are not free. We recommend paid VPNs, as free VPNs don’t guarantee safety and privacy. If you’re not sure what VPN you can trust, we recommend[**NordVPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 NordVPN is one of the popular VPNs around the world, a cheap VPN with high performance. It provides a stable connection and 24/7 customer support. It provides more than 5000 servers for customers to connect. Schools can’t discover all these servers. It provides a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you aren’t satisfied with the product, you can ask for a full refund.

 To use NordVPN to unblock Fortnite at school, you just need to follow these steps:

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) NordVPN to your computer (You can get a 75% discount if you purchase the product right now.).

2) Run NordVPN and open it.

3) Connect to a server by choosing a country you want to connect to.

### Unblock Fortnite at school using a Chrome extension

 You can unblock Fortnite with a free Chrome extension. Some extensions provided by Chrome can change your IP (Internet Protocol) address to some other countries. This is to place your computer outside your school. Then you can access any websites, or items blocked by your school, like Fortnite.

 What you need to do is find a trustworthy extension. If you don’t know how to find a good extension, you can try Ultrasurf.

 Ultrasurf is a trustworthy extension with a 4.5-star review in the Chrome store. Harvard University Berkman Center Circumvention Landscape Report said Ultrasurf is “the best performing of all the tested tools”. With Ultrasurf, you can use public wifi safely and securely, encrypt your traffic, and hide your IP and location.

 With Ultrasurf, you can access Fortnite without limit. When you’re watching videos on Fortnite, the bandwidth usage can be increasing. Though the school IT administrators find that the bandwidth usage is increasing, they won’t know who is using the bandwidth.

To use Ultrasurf, you just need to add it to your Chrome browser.

 1) Go to[Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ultrasurf-security-privac/mjnbclmflcpookeapghfhapeffmpodij) , and add Ultrasurf to Chrome.
