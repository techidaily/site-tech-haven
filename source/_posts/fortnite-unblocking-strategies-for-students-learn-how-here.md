 Many schools use firewalls to block Fortnite because they think Fortnite can be a distraction from studying. They want their students to focus on their studies. In addition, playing Fortnite requires a huge amount of bandwidth. Schools don’t want to spend money on the bandwidth caused by playing games.

 School IT administrators block Fortnite through the entire school network. If you use the school Wi-Fi to play Fortnite, no matter what devices you use, you can’t bypass the restriction.
