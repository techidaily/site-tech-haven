Next week, Apple is holding its ['Glowtime' event,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-to-expect-from-apples-iphone-16-its-glowtime-event-and-how-to-watch-the-livestream/) in which the company is expected to release its newest hardware lineup, including the [iPhone 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-you-shouldnt-buy-the-iphone-16-for-apple-intelligence/) series. If you are in the market for a new iPhone, you may want to purchase new charging accessories, and lucky for you, Anker just released some new accessories that offer more than Apple's for less.

On Thursday, at the [IFA 2024](https://www.ifa-berlin.com/) trade show in Berlin, Germany, Anker added five new charging accessories to its MagGo line, including a charging station, power banks, and stands. The accessories incorporate Qi2 charging standards, support up to 15 watts of wireless charging, and feature Apple's Magnetic Power Profile (MPP) technology for a more stable charging experience. 

A launch highlight is the [Anker MagGo](https://www.anker.com/maggo-magsafe-compatible-wireless-charger?) Wireless Charging Station (3-in-1, Foldable Pad), an Apple power user's dream. It can charge an iPhone, AirPods, and an Apple Watch simultaneously, helping users avoid the mess of multiple chargers and wires while keeping a compact and lightweight design.

A bonus feature s is that you can adjust the folding pad to hold up your iPhone, enabling users to stream videos landscape or take advantage of StandBy Mode. The MagGo Wireless Charging Station (3-in-1, Foldable Pad) is available for pre-order today in black and white colorways, with green and pink available later this year.
