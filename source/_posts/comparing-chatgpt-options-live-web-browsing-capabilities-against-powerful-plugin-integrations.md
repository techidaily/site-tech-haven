## How to Create AIPRM Prompts

 Although thousands of prompts are available on AIPRM, you may sometimes need a more personalized prompt. So, why bother crafting your prompt in AIPRM rather than using it directly in ChatGPT? This can be useful when you need to reuse the prompt for a similar task in the future.

To create a custom AIPRM prompt:

 First, click the**Own** tab on the main page. Next, click**Add Private Prompt** , and a new prompt template will appear.

 Next, fill out all the details of your prompt. Note that providing more detailed information in the**Prompt Template** field will increase your prompt's value and the response quality from ChatGPT. Let's say you wish to create a prompt to promote your business on Facebook. You can provide specific details like the name of your business, your services, your target audience, hashtags to use, and the tone of voice. In the same field, create the task by writing the instructions that ChatGPT will follow to generate the desired text.

![AIPRM screenshot showing how to create a template](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/create-aiprm-prompt-template.jpeg)

 For instance, "Write a Facebook post with emojis and a call to action about**\[PROMPT\]** ." Make sure to add the prompt variable**\[PROMPT\]** in your template, as it will be replaced by what you type whenever you use this prompt. In this example, the prompt variable**\[PROMPT\]** will be the topic for the Facebook post. You can also provide one or more examples of what you want the output to look like.

 Next, fill in the**Teaser** field. This is a description to help you remember the prompt easily. The**Prompt Hint** reminds you of what you will type in when using the prompt. This replaces the prompt variable**\[PROMPT\]** .

 Now, choose a**Title** for your prompt. This can be anything that will help you remember the purpose of the prompt.

 Lastly, select the**Topic** ,**Activity** ,**Who can see this?** and**Made for** (the ChatGPT model). Write your**Author Name** and**Author URL** . Click**Save Prompt** to finalize the creation of your prompt.

![AIPRM for ChatGPT prompt template creation page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/aiprm-prompt-template-creation.jpeg)

 Once your prompt is saved, you can find it under the**Own** tab.

 You have just created your first AIPRM prompt! Test it out and see what kind of response you get from ChatGPT. You can always edit your prompt by clicking the**pencil** icon next to it.

 AIPRM for ChatGPT is a handy productivity tool that can help you get relevant and quality responses from ChatGPT. Its vast library of expertly crafted prompts makes it easier to interact with ChatGPT and get the desired output. With AIPRM, you can save time, be more productive, and have fun experimenting with different prompt templates.
