## **Method 2:** **Update drivers**

 Updating drivers should always be your go-to option when your computer or system doesn’t work as smoothly as you expected. Drivers are the interpreters between a computer and all its devices. With faulty and outdated drivers, your computer may bring you troubles. Therefore, it’s essential that you have the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs. Here’s how to update drivers with Driver Easy:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
