## Top Mobile Phone Bargains on Independence Day: Unbeatable Promotions

Three things are certain during the 4th of July: Fireworks (with a suspiciously high chance of rain), barbeques (with overcooked steaks), and [deals](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-4th-of-july-sales-2024-07-01/) \-- lots of deals. Specifically, if you're in the market for a new phone, there's a plethora of offers this week that will make your shopping journey a little less expensive.

I've rounded up the best phone deals ahead of Independence Day below, including discounts on the latest [iPhones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/), [Samsung Galaxy](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-samsung-phone/), [Google Pixel](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-google-phone/), and more. While I don't expect these deals to last, I also don't expect them to drop any lower later this week, so grab them while they're hot.

I reviewed Apple's latest non-Pro iPhone for about six months and found it to be more premium and capable than previous generations. Features like the 48MP main sensor, A16 Bionic chip, USB-C charging, and Dynamic Island make the iPhone 15 a very competent device for most users, including professionals. And right now, the Apple Store is offering a free iPhone 15 with an eligible trade-in for Verizon and T-Mobile customers.

In contention for the best phone of the year, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra flaunts a large 6.8-inch AMOLED display, a reliable Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, and a reliable set of cameras, capable of capturing distant subjects. The Samsung flagship carries all the bells and whistles, including a built-in S Pen that graphic designers, artists, and even students can enjoy. Right now, it's discounted by $200 on Amazon.

Foldable phones are only slightly cheaper than when they first debuted, but that means they're also more accessible than ever. Of all the foldable phones we've tested, the OnePlus Open is the best option available, with a compact form factor that makes the phone-to-tablet device surprisingly easy to use, a fantastic triple-camera setup at the rear, and OnePlus' signature 65W fast charging. You can save more when you trade in an eligible device, bringing the OnePlus Open down to as low as $599\.

If you're one of the many who bought and own a phone under a carrier like AT&T and Verizon, there's a good chance it offers a decent trade-in deal for the latest devices. Case in point: AT&T is currently discounting up to $1,000 off the iPhone 15 Pro Max when you trade in an eligible phone and are on a qualifying unlimited plan, bringing the total down to $200\. 

The payments must be divided across 36 months, meaning part of the catch is for you to remain an AT&T customer for three years, but if you don't see yourself switching anytime soon, then the offer is worth considering.

For a budget option, consider the Motorola Moto G 5G (2023). It rolls right off the tongue, I know. For the money, you're getting a sizable 6.5-inch display that refreshes at 120Hz, 5G support for T-Mobile and Verizon customers, and a 5,000mAh battery that should last you up to two days of usage. Will the phone best the latest Google Pixel in a camera shootout? Definitely not. But it'll suffice for anyone looking for a decent handset that won't break the bank.

## How did we choose these 4th of July deals?

ZDNET only writes about deals we want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops. 

We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## What is the best phone?

Right now, ZDNET's pick for the [best phone overall](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/) is the [Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review/). It features everything you could want from a smartphone, including a large display, four cameras that can shoot 200MP photos and 8K video, up to 1TB of storage, a built-in S Pen for writing and drawing, and a 5,000mAh battery powering the system.

## Factors to consider when choosing a phone

The process of making our phone selections includes real-world testing and researching about the phones for weeks, consulting with colleagues, industry experts, and analysts who also have hands-on experience with the smartphones, and then selecting the best from all of the available choices. 

Ultimately, we weigh in the following aspects when curating this list:

* **Design**: There's only so much you can do with a slab design, but size differences, material choices, color options, and even the ability to bend a screen in half give shoppers enough diversity to have a preference. That's why we have a recommendation for every form factor.
* **Performance**: For many, smartphones are the center of our lives, which means the best ones are performant and can handle most, if not all, tasks you throw at them.
* **Camera**: Arguably the most valuable feature of a smartphone; the consistency and reliability of a camera system can make or break the overall mobile experience. We test every device in broad daylight and in the darkest of nights when finalizing this list.
* **Battery**: Every option in this guide should last you at least a day of moderate use. We also consider what devices support fast charging and/or wireless charging.
* **Value**: Price points are noted, but the most important thing with buying a phone is getting your money's worth. With these picks, you can rest assured that you're getting the best bang for your buck.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## How much storage should my phone have?

Most smartphones have a base storage capacity of 128GB, which is plenty of space for average users to download apps and music, take photos, and shoot videos. However, if you're a mobile or creative professional, you'll need more space. Many smartphones have expanded storage options up to 512GB or even 1TB, and you can always sync your phone to your preferred cloud storage service to free up local storage space.
