<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tips

* Be honest. Your chats will only be stored on the ChatGPT server and can easily be deleted.
* Use open-ended questions to get the best responses.
* Define your problem clearly.

 While ChatGPT can act as a virtual therapist, it cannot replace actual therapy. Always opt for qualified mental health experts who can provide the right care and support for serious mental health concerns and crises.

 ChatGPT can easily compete with, or even go on to replace, search engines like Google. It provides a conversational search experience with contextual comprehension, summary skills, and an enormous knowledge base. You can also search within your ChatGPT chats for answers to your previous queries.

### Tips

1. Ask a clear, specific question.
2. Add context or ask questions to refine your search.
