### Tips

* Be honest. Your chats will only be stored on the ChatGPT server and can easily be deleted.
* Use open-ended questions to get the best responses.
* Define your problem clearly.

 ChatGPT can easily compete with, or even go on to replace, search engines like Google. It provides a conversational search experience with contextual comprehension, summary skills, and an enormous knowledge base. You can also search within your ChatGPT chats for answers to your previous queries.

### Tips

1. Ask a clear, specific question.
2. Add context or ask questions to refine your search.
