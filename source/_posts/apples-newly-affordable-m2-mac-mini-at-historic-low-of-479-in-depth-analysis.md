At its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) today, Apple is set to unveil the latest AI innovations and updates to iOS, iPadOS, MacOS, and the rest of its software ensemble. We'll be covering the event live from California, so be sure to stay tuned on [ZDNET.com](https://www.zdnet.com/) as we share all the best updates, features, and announcements from the long-awaited event. 

Right now, you can save $120 on Apple's latest [M2 Mac mini](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BSHGHGXR%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C8dba16d1-144b-4eb8-90aa-ddd28a4a9ea6%7Cdtp&dtb=1), which just dropped to an all-time low price of $479 at [Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BSHGHGXR%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C8dba16d1-144b-4eb8-90aa-ddd28a4a9ea6%7Cdtp&dtb=1).

Just like its predecessor the M1 Mac Mini, the M2 Mac Mini doesn't have an overabundance of ports, but ZDNET reviewer Michael Gariffo said it's got enough to handle nearly all home uses and the majority of professional workstation setups. 

"The M1 Mini totally disrupted the home PC industry for a reason, and its [M2 follow-up](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-mac-mini-with-m2-chip-is-faster-more-capable-and-somehow-cheaper/) just enhances its accomplishments by taking a level of performance that was already more than most users needed and boosting it even further... If you need a desktop for your home or business, this is almost certainly the one to get," Gariffo said in his review.
