 It might not be the most popular social network anymore, but Facebook is still really useful in a lot of ways. Learn about all the reasons why you should reconsider deleting your Facebook profile, and give the platform a second chance.

 There was a time when it seemed everybody used Facebook all the time. But over the years, lots of people shifted to other apps, like Instagram and [the increasingly popular TikTok](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-efficiently-capturing-professional-movies-on-your-windows-pc/). Did everyone delete their Facebook accounts, though? No. Why? Because there are still a lot of useful features on there!

## 1  Facebook Marketplace Is a Goldmine 

 When Facebook Marketplace launched, it was a game changer. Before Facebook Marketplace, I was taking my chances on eBay and Craigslist, neither of which have a stellar reputation for safety.

 Facebook Marketplace gives people a place to buy and sell with other Facebook users and small businesses, in an environment that takes everyone's privacy very seriously. Buyers and sellers don't share their entire Facebook profile when participating in a Marketplace transaction, so you don't have to worry about sharing unwanted personal information when you connect.

 There's a huge variety of items that you can find on Facebook Marketplace, from used toys and clothing, to car parts and even apartment rentals, making it a great place for treasure hunting. I recently found a Nintendo Switch Lite in "like new" condition from a nearby seller, and had a much better experience than when I was bidding for the same product on eBay!

 Facebook Marketplace users get a full suite of tools within the Marketplace tab, making it easy to keep sales and potential buyers organized. There is a separate inbox dedicated to conversations about Marketplace purchases.

 Caution and common sense is still required ([make sure to follow these Facebook Marketplace tips and tricks!](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/masterful-marketing-essential-expressions-for-professionals-for-2024/)) but it's a great way to spot rare deals in your local area.

## 2  Get the Group Together With Facebook Groups 

 People love to come together online to share their love for a particular topic. Facebook Groups allow people to join together and talk about anything and everything in a dedicated space. Facebook Group admins are given a wide selection of tools to set up their group, such as deciding if the group should be public or private, what information a potential member should provide in order to join, as well as moderation tools.

 The most important feature for Facebook Group admins is the fact that Groups are free for anyone to create, unlike websites like Meetup which require group leaders to pay a fee to maintain the group (and that cost is usually passed along to Meetup group members). This makes Facebook Groups a much more appealing choice for organizers.

 You can join any number of Facebook Groups, and create as many as you want. I like to pin my favorite Groups to the top of the section for easy access. The Groups tab even has a "For You" section with Top Action Items and suggested groups that you might be interested in joining, based on your recent activity and the Groups and Pages that you interact with on Facebook.

[You can even tag everyone in a Group](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-screen-lock-pin-on-tecno-like-a-pro-5-easy-ways-by-drfone-android/) to notify everyone at once (please use this sparingly, though).

## 3  Find Local Events on Facebook 

 If you're looking for ideas for fun things to do in your area, or if you want to make sure you know who's going to be at your friend's birthday party, Facebook Events has you covered. Event Pages have been a staple within the Facebook ecosystem for a long time, and for good reason. I like to use it to easily invite all my friends to a party (or see who else is attending), and find out about local concerts, meetups, and other public events happening near me.

Close 

 The Facebook Events section organizes upcoming events by date and your RSVP status. When you view an Event Page, you can easily access details like the date, time, address, and who is attending.

 If you don't have anything upcoming on your calendar, the Events section can offer suggestions based on your interests, which Groups you and your friends are in, and what events your friends might be attending in the near future. It's a great way to explore new places and meet new people.

## 4  Follow Small Businesses on Facebook 

 Online commerce goes a step further with Facebook Pages, which is where small businesses and brands can set up mini home pages and talk about their products. Some businesses can't afford a website and run their entire operation through their Facebook Page.

 Many would argue that there's way too much brand-focused content on Facebook (and I would agree). But before you start un-following every brand, keep in mind that small businesses are using Facebook to keep you informed on the latest and greatest they have to offer.

 A local restaurant might be testing out a new secret menu item, and only share the info with people who follow their Facebook Page. There could be special sales or coupon codes from small online retailers that they only share on Facebook. A new product launch might be announced on Facebook before it hits the stores.

 It's worth giving your favorite brands a "like" to make sure you are up-to-date on the latest news.

## 5  Keep in Touch With the Facebook Fam 

 We all know who the really active people are on Facebook. When those floodgates opened up in 2006, everybody joined Facebook. And that means _everybody!_ People of all ages rushed to create a profile, so even your auntie and grandma are likely to have a Facebook profile.

 I love how easy it is to see the latest baby photos and important personal updates from my family whenever I log onto Facebook. Unlike other platforms, your direct connections are more likely to be featured in the news feed.

 Facebook was designed for you to keep in touch with your loved ones, and for many people, their extended family are some of the more active users on the platform. It's easy to stay in touch and[share HD photos and videos with your family on Facebook Messenger](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-the-insiders-guide-to-mastering-fb-live-recordings-for-2024/), and you can call or video chat with a single tap of a button. There's no excuse, go call your mom!

---

 It's true, the general age demographic of Facebook might be skewing older, but that doesn't make it a bad thing. Facebook Marketplace deals are getting better and better. Facebook Groups are free and help you find people to connect with, and Event Pages bring people together IRL. Facebook keeps you in touch with your family and updated on the latest news that you might actually care about in your local area.

 So, while you might not be scrolling through the Facebook News Feed anymore, it's still worth popping into the app and checking out some of these features that you might have forgotten about. Great finds and experiences could be just a tap away!
