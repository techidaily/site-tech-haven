 If you have an Intel Mac, you won't be able to install Copilot's iPad app from the Mac App Store. Instead, you'll need to install Microsoft Copilot as a web app on macOS Sonoma or later:

2. Open Safari and head to[Microsoft Copilot's webpage](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) .
3. Now, click**File > Add to Dock** from the menu bar.
4. When you get a confirmation pop-up, click**Add** .

![Adding Copilot web app to the Dock](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/adding-copilot-web-app-to-the-dock.jpg)

 You'll find the Copilot web app on your Dock immediately. Launch it to begin.

## Getting Started With Microsoft Copilot on Your Mac

3. You can choose from**Creative** ,**Balanced** , and**Precise** . By default, it's set to**Creative** , which gets you descriptive responses. I use the**Precise** setting as I prefer concise responses with only the facts that I need.

## The Benefits of Using Copilot Over ChatGPT

 The biggest advantage of using Microsoft's AI chatbot over OpenAI's ChatGPT offering is that you can[access GPT-4 for free](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-access-gpt-4-free/) . This means you can include images in your queries, take advantage of DALLÂ·E 3 art generation, install third-party plugins to expand Copilot's feature set, and more.

 ChatGPT users, on the other hand, have to[pay a monthly fee for a ChatGPT Plus subscription](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-plus-subscription-worth-it/) to access these features. Even though it's possible to[use ChatGPT on a Mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-mac/) , you won't find the iPhone or iPad version of ChatGPT on the Mac App Store.

 It's also worth noting that ChatGPT doesn't let you change the tone of its responses like Copilot. All in all, if you want the best AI chatbot experience on your Mac without having to spend a penny, Microsoft Copilot is your best betâ€”at least for now.
