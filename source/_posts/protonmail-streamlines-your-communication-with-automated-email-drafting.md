## ProtonMail Streamlines Your Communication with Automated Email Drafting

Your favorite privacy-focused service is joining the AI bandwagon. [Proton Mail](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004231/https://proton.me/mail) now features an AI writing assistant called Scribe. It promises to help you write and revise emails without collecting your personal data.

[Scribe](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004231/https://proton.me/blog/proton-scribe-writing-assistant) works like any other AI writing assistant. Give it a prompt, and it generates text. Ask it to revise or proof-read your email draft, and it will do so.

 Similar tools are built into Gmail and Outlook. The thing that makes Scribe special is that it doesn't collect or transmit data. It runs locally on your device and is bound by end-to-end encryption, meaning that interactions with Scribe will never be seen by Proton or any other companies (barring some catastrophic security failure, of course).

 This local AI functionality is not limited to the Proton Mail desktop app. It also works when accessing Proton Mail through a Chromium web browser, such Chrome or Edge. That said, if you aren't using a Chromium browser, all Scribe activity is processed through a "secure, no-logs server." Proton is currently working to bring local Scribe support [to Firefox](http://mastodon.social/@protonprivacy/112807399837648341), and you can test it in [Firefox Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/).

 Users can manually opt for the no-logs server if they don't want to run Scribe locally. I assume that this will be the preferred option when accessing Proton Mail from a public workstation or an employer-provided PC. It may also provide faster AI performance on underpowered machines.

> "Proton Scribe is not trained on data from users’ inboxes, and it would be impossible for it to do so due to Proton’s zero-access encryption. Proton has a policy of never retaining any data that users type into Proton Scribe. It is built, operated and run by Proton, meaning that no data is shared with any third parties, and there is no “partnership” with outside firms like OpenAI. Proton Scribe has been developed on top of open-source models and is itself open-source, allowing for independent privacy and security audits to take place."

 And, to my relief, Proton is keen on avoiding some of the less-than-obvious problems that often come with AI integration. Customers who want to use Scribe do not need to agree to a new privacy policy, for example, and third parties like OpenAI are not affiliated with this project in any way. The AI is based on open-source models and is itself open-source.

 I assume that a lot of Proton's customers will disable Scribe (which is allowed, by the way). Generative AI has ushered in a new [era of data collection](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/approved-mastering-timeliness-using-current-events-to-your-advantage/) that many people see as a threat to personal privacy, so some pushback makes sense.

 That said, the whole sales pitch behind Proton is that it offers Google-like services without compromising user privacy. If you already trust Proton's email, password management, or cloud storage services, I'm not sure why you'd be afraid of Scribe.

 Proton Scribe is currently limited to Business, Visionary, and Lifetime subscribers. The AI only works in [Proton Mail](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004231/https://proton.me/mail), though I assume that it'll roll out to [Proton Docs](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-key-methods-for-silent-screen-imaging/) at some point in the future, for better or worse.
