## Are the Newly Released 2022 AirPods Pro Worth Your Money? A Comprehensive Review by an Expert  Findings

During its [annual hardware event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-announced-at-iphone-16-event-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-ai-more/), Apple announced the [iPhone 16 lineup](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-compared-which-new-iphone-should-you-buy/), [new AirPods](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-airpods-4-vs-apple-airpods-4-with-noise-cancellation-which-earbuds-fit-you-best/), and a new [Apple Watch](https://www.zdnet.com/article/preorder-the-new-apple-watch-series-10-now-heres-how-plus-ways-to-save/). Although the event's primary focus is always on new iPhones, I like to tune in to catch a glimpse of the latest [AirPods](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-airpods/). I was happy to see the AirPods 4 model with noise cancellation and upgraded software features, but I secretly hoped for the AirPods Pro 3.

**Also: [Your AirPods Pro 2 are getting a free audio upgrade, and it's the most important one yet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-airpods-pro-2-are-getting-a-free-audio-upgrade-and-its-the-most-important-one-yet/)**

Unfortunately, a new AirPods Pro model didn't make an appearance. Still, Apple announced auditory health features and valuable software upgrades coming to the existing AirPods Pro 2 earbuds when iOS 18 arrives later this month.

The holidays are approaching, and you may wonder if buying the [AirPods Pro 2](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized%2Fdp%2FB0D1XD1ZV3%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C1f79f912-b4ad-4b88-b4c7-582d402ee675%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is a good idea, despite debuting two years ago. I've had mine in my ears since then, and they're still my number one trusty earbuds. Are the AirPods Pro 2 still worth it in 2024? The short answer is yes, but there are a few caveats. Allow me to explain.

## Apple hasn't forgotten about the AirPods Pro 2

A tell-tale sign that a company is phasing out a product is when it is no longer compatible with the latest software updates. During this year's Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced two major software upgrades for the AirPods Pro 2.

The upcoming [Siri Interactions and Voice Isolation features](https://www.zdnet.com/article/3-useful-features-coming-to-apple-airpods-this-fall-but-only-for-these-models/) should make the AirPods Pro 2 earbuds more intuitive and enhance their integration with your other Apple devices. Additionally, the US FDA has [granted Apple approval](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fda-approves-apples-new-hearing-aid-feature-for-airpods-pro-2/) to classify the AirPods Pro 2 earbuds as over-the-counter hearing aids and is introducing a clinically graded hearing test to make them more than a vessel for listening to music and taking phone calls.

## The most unique (and important) Pro feature

Although the new [mid-tier AirPods 4](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-upcoming-budget-airpods-may-borrow-a-useful-feature-from-the-pro-model/) bridge the software gap between Apple's lower-end earbuds and the premium AirPods Pro 2 earbuds, the latter are more comfortable to wear for extended periods and deliver the most advanced audio experience.

**Also: [Which Apple AirPods 4 model should you buy? Here are the key differences](https://www.zdnet.com/article/which-apple-airpods-4-model-should-you-buy-here-are-the-key-differences/)**

The AirPods Pro 2's silicon ear tips sport an in-canal design, which provides a more immersive listening experience. Historically, Apple products that bear the "Pro" moniker have slight but powerful design variations that make them more suitable for pro-level users and provide maximum utility.

In this case, the silicon ear tips put the "pro" in the AirPods Pro 2\. The other AirPods options are in-ear earbuds, meaning they rest on the outside of your ear and allow more ambient noise into your ears, offering a more open-ear sound experience.

Jada Jones/ZDNET

The AirPods Pro 2's in-canal fit creates a tighter seal between your ear and the outside world. They're best for people who frequently take and make hands-free calls or need the full extent of these earbuds' noise-canceling capabilities. Although the AirPods 4 with noise cancellation share the same audio chip and features as the Pro 2, the differences in fit completely alter how the earbuds interact with your ears.

## ZDNET's buying advice

I highly recommend AirPods to people with at least one Apple device, especially an [iPhone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/). You can use AirPods with non-Apple devices, but you'll pay for limited functionality.

If you're adamant about waiting for the AirPods Pro 3, I understand your thought process, but you'll be waiting until sometime next year. Thankfully, the new model will be even more advanced, as Bloomberg's Mark Gurman predicts features like [a heart-rate sensor](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-airpods-pro-3-may-be-your-new-fitness-coach-wtih-a-built-in-heart-rate-sensor/), enhanced audio quality and noise cancellation, and a redesigned case.

**Also: [iPhone 16 Pro hands-on: My 3 favorite things about this ridiculously overpowered supercomputer](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-hands-on/)**

If those purported features don't excite you, the AirPods Pro 2 will do just fine. Keep an eye out for sales; you can frequently find these earbuds for as low as $189, only $10 more than the new AirPods 4 with noise cancellation.

My only regret regarding my AirPods Pro 2 earbuds is that I paid full price for them. Still, even at full price, they are cheaper (and more advanced) than Sony's, Bose's, Google's, and Samsung's premium flagship earbuds.
