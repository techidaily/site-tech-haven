When the [iPhone 15](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-plus-review/) launched, Apple specifically [pointed out the device's focus on repairability](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-iphone-15-isnt-as-repairable-as-apple-wants-you-to-believe/). Mobile device repair specialists iFixit [would later reveal](https://www.ifixit.com/News/82867/iphone-15-teardown-reveals-software-lockdown) that repairability was held back a little by Apple's DRM, but it appears the latest iPhone -- the iPhone 16 -- addresses those issues.

First up is a new way to remove the iPhone's battery. The iPhone 15 and previous models used glue that was notoriously difficult to deal with, but the iPhone 16 has a special adhesive that loosens when you apply a low-voltage charge like a 9V battery, making it significantly easier and faster to remove. This glue is present on the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus, but not the Pro model.

**Also: [We've used every iPhone 16 model and here's our best buying advice for 2024](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/)**

But even with all the [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/) features we know about and considering that Apple will likely reserve new ones to announce during the September 9 event,

Also new is a Repair Assistant that is included with iOS 18\. The feature is open to both repair professionals and regular consumers and allows them to configure parts – both new and used. Apple [announced this feature in April](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-to-expand-repair-options-with-support-for-used-genuine-parts/), saying, "the new process is designed to maintain an iPhone user's privacy, security, and safety, while offering consumers more options, increasing product longevity, and minimizing the environmental impact of a repair." 

Apple says used or third-party parts will have the same functionality and security as original ones.

On-board diagnostics are coming too, letting customers know what part is malfunctioning. Previously, you would have needed another phone to run this tool.

Finally, Apple is making it easier to replace the Face ID sensor. Previously, only Apple could swap out this part, but now anyone can replace the TrueDepth Camera on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro. [Engadget adds](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reveals-how-its-made-the-iphone-16-series-much-easier-to-repair-120055256.html) that the LiDAR scanner is now replaceable too.

Not only is Apple adding several tools for you to diagnose your phone problems on your own, but it's significantly widening support for non-Apple parts. IFixIt hasn't officially revealed the phone's repairability score, but it should be a big leap from before.
