## Apple Watch Series 10 Review: The Top 3 Features That Impressed a Doubter  Insights

![Apple Watch Series 10](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/dc91ab475c5353baf5d16233b095a2d198899ce2/2024/09/09/6c05f95e-f0cb-4a97-a0df-bf28a22da0ac/dsc02045.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

The Apple Watch is one of the most popular smartwatches, and its integration with the Apple ecosystem makes it a go-to for iPhone fans. Apple recently held its [annual September event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-to-expect-from-apples-iphone-16-its-glowtime-event-and-how-to-watch-the-livestream/), announcing a new lineup of [iPhone 16](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [AirPods 4](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fairpods-4%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), and [Apple Watch Series 10](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), now available for pre-order.

Many features come with the Apple Watch's new upgrade, which marks the company's 10th smartwatch model, including what seems to be one of the biggest redesigns yet. Here's what we look forward to about the newest Apple Watch:

## 1\. One of the biggest Apple Watch redesigns ever

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

The [Apple Watch](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/)'s aesthetic has remained largely unchanged for the past 10 years since its launch. Apple did a big redesign with the [Apple Watch 7](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-7-review/) three years ago, but most of the upgrades since then have been largely internal -- until now. 

The Apple Watch Series 10 got its first big redesign since the launch of the Series 7\. While we didn't expect Apple to give it a huge redesign, as the company has proven loyal to its renowned aesthetic, I was glad to see that the Apple Watch 10 will have larger screen options and a considerably thinner design. Powered by the new S10 SiP, the Apple Watch Series 10 is 10% thinner than the Series 9.

**Also: [Apple's most affordable Watch SE model may be getting a revamp soon. Here's what's new](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-most-affordable-watch-se-model-may-be-getting-a-revamp-soon-heres-whats-new/)**

We didn't get a redesigned Apple Watch Ultra, as Apple is expected to focus on internal updates rather than the physical look, but we did see a new Satin Black finish.

## 2\. Extra health tracking: sleep apnea

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

In true Apple fashion, the iPhone maker [appears to be](https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/06/sleep-apnea-apple-watch-series-10/) taking a page out of Samsung's playbook by giving the Apple Watch sleep apnea detection for the first time. This feature builds on the Apple Watch's current sleep-tracking capabilities, which give wearers insight into their sleep trends by processing heart rate, oxygenation, movement, and breathing data during sleep. But it also has a new metric powered by the watch's accelerometer, which the company calls "breathing disturbances."

If the smartwatch detects patterns consistent with sleep apnea during sleep, the wearer will receive a notification and a prompt to contact a healthcare provider for testing. 

**Also: [Apple Watch Series 10 vs. Apple Watch Series 9: Should you upgrade to the latest model?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-10-vs-apple-watch-series-9-should-you-upgrade-to-the-latest-model/)**

The Apple Watch's sleep apnea detection isn't expected to be immediately available upon the release of the new devices. The company will likely roll it out with a software update later to the Watch Series 10, Series 9, and Ultra 2.

Apple also announced new WatchOS 11 features for the Apple Watch, including offline maps and water features like Depth, Water Temperature, and Tides.

## 3\. New Apple Watch finishes

The [Apple Watch SE](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-apple-watch-se-2nd-gen-is-still-80-off-after-amazon-prime-day/) is due for an upgrade -- but while we expected Apple to release new versions of all Apple Watch models for the first time in a couple of years, Apple only announced a new Apple Watch Series 10 and the new Apple Watch Ultra 2 color and band. 

The Apple Watch Series 10 is available in Jet Black, Rose Gold, and Silver Aluminum. The company announced a new finish, Polished Titanium, which replaces the stainless steel finish from Series 9 with a new titanium wristband.

The Apple Watch Series 10 starts at $399, available for pre-order today, with general availability on September 20\.

### 1\. Blood oxygen tracking has yet to return

[A lawsuit from Masimo Corp embroiled Apple](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-court-upholds-rulings-apple-masimo-smartwatch-patent-fight-2023-09-12/) in a legal battle over its newest Apple Watch's blood oxygen sensors, forcing the company to remove the blood oxygen tracking feature completely. 

Unfortunately, the new Apple Watch models didn't bring back the blood oxygen monitoring. 

**Also: [Here's one big reason I'm sticking with my Apple Watch Series 7 and forgoing the Series 10](https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-one-big-reason-im-sticking-with-my-apple-watch-series-7-and-forgoing-the-series-10/)**

Currently, the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra don't have the blood oxygen sensor enabled, so users looking to upgrade from an older model (Apple Watch Series 6, 7, 8, and Ultra) should know they'll likely lose that feature until Apple resolves its issue.

### 2\. No hypertension capabilities yet

While Apple is constantly working behind the scenes to give its wearables extra health-tracking features, some aren't quite ready for the market yet -- blood pressure measuring is one example. 

**Also: [The best smartwatches of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/)**

Many users have expected Apple to release blood pressure monitoring on the Apple Watch for some time, especially since the [Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 launched with blood pressure tracking](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review/). It appears 2024 isn't the year for Apple, as the feature is reportedly delayed and not planned for the new models launching today.
