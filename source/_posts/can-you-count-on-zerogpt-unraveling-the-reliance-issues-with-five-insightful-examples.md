## Transforming DIY Innovation with the Upcoming Arrival of GPT-Navigate Through AI's Next Giant Leap

 Artificial intelligence has come a long way in recent years, and OpenAI's GPT-4 is set to be the next big thing in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The text generation language model’s current version, GPT-3.5, has surpassed people’s expectations with conversational capabilities ranging from chat companionship to code generation.

 It is public information that OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is developing GPT-4, 3.5’s successor. Upcoming model details are undisclosed, but it's speculated to be a more robust and capable version.

 Cloud-based data analysis by GPT-4, integrated with microcontroller-based platforms like Arduino, will offer DIYers a more productive approach to product development.

## Multi-Modal AI and DIY: What Is a Multi-Modal AI?
