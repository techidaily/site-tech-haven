## 1\. ChatGPT for Google

 ChatGPT is an AI tool that has proven incredibly useful. It's a language model that produces fascinating results across a variety of fields of learning and interest.

 ChatGPT for Google is a Chrome extension that integrates ChatGPT’s insights into your search results. This means that once you launch a search on your Chrome browser, you'll see responses from ChatGPT on the side.

![The ChatGPT for Google Extension in Chrome](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-showing-the-chatgpt-for-google-extension-in-chrome.jpg)

 As such, this extension helps you compare search results from both platforms. It can also be useful for comparing and detecting errors or discrepancies, as AI-generated responses are usually prone to such things.

 You can share your results from the extension by generating a link or using the**Copy** feature to export the conversation elsewhere.

 Additionally, there are a few setting options to tweak your search. You can choose to have the ChatGPT response displayed on every search. Otherwise, you can set it so that the response comes up only when your search includes a question mark or the click of a button.

 You can also set a display theme, select a language, or switch between ChatGPT’s web app and OpenAI’s API. Ultimately, if you are looking for an effective way to compare Chrome search results with ChatGPT-generated content, this extension is up your alley.
