 By hiding the top bar and dock, you can enjoy a host of advantages, such as more screen space, reduced visual clutter, improved user experience, and more. It also adds a touch of elegance to your desktop.

 Auto-hiding the top bar and dock can give you a distraction-free workspace, and it maximizes your working area, especially if you have a smaller screen. It can also hide active apps and notifications from people looking at your screen.

 Still, you may not want the top bar and dock completely gone in [Ubuntu](https://common-error.techidaily.com/overcoming-graphics-card-not-supported-hurdles-in-fortnite-for-windows-users/). They're two graphical components that make accessing applications, settings, and notifications a breeze. These elements improve your experience and ensure easy navigation within the system. Whether you need to launch an app, tweak your settings, or stay updated with notifications, the Ubuntu top bar and dock have got you covered.

 Ultimately, the decision to hide the top bar and dock in Ubuntu is a matter of your personal preference and specific needs. You have the option to either hide them permanently or set them to auto-hide, depending on what you like.

##  How to Hide the Top Bar in Ubuntu

 To hide the top bar in Ubuntu, all you have to do is install the "Hide Top Bar" extension. By default, Ubuntu has no settings to hide the top bar. After installing this extension, you have the choice to either hide the top bar permanently or set it to auto-hide when any open window touches it.

 Before you proceed with the installation, first [open the terminal](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-old-music-from-your-xiaomi-14-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-music/) and [update your system's package list](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-innovative-copywriting-routines-adopting-three-key-approaches-to-fb-advertising/):

sudo apt update

 As there is no default setting to hide the top bar, you'll have to install GNOME Extension Manager on Ubuntu.

 Run the given command to install both the GNOME Shell Extensions package and GNOME Extension Manager:

sudo apt install gnome-shell-extensions gnome-shell-extension-manager

 Now, open the installed Extension Manager from the application menu.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Extension Manager will show you a list of all the extensions that are already installed on Ubuntu. Simply, navigate to the "Browse" tab, and in the search box, type "Hide Top Bar" to locate the extension. Then, click "Install."

![Search option displaying the Hide Top Bar extension and install button](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-6.png) 

 If you do not see the "Hide Top Bar" extension, change the search filter from "Popularity" to "Recent."

 After installing the extension, you can easily hide the top bar by dragging any window towards it.

![The top bar is hidden after dragging a window near it](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-5.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 The top bar also disappears when you maximize an application window. To bring it back, simply minimize the window that touches it.

 You can also modify the Hide Top Bar extension settings. To do this, launch Extension Manager and switch to the "Installed" tab. Look for the "Hide Top Bar" extension. Next to it, you'll see a gear icon. Click on it to open the settings.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Here you will get different settings related to the top bar, such as sensitivity, animation, and others. You can even assign a keyboard shortcut to hide the top bar. Take a look at the given settings and tweak them as required.

![The Hide Top Bar extension settings menu](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/6-5.png) 

 With default settings, this extension tucks away the top bar when you drag a window near it. However, you can also permanently hide the top bar with a simple tweak in the settings. To do this, simply navigate to the "Intellihide" tab and disable the first option.

![The intellihide settings menu of the Hide Top Bar extension](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/7-5.png) 

 Now the top bar will remain hidden, independent of the other application window movements.

 When you enable the Hide Top Bar extension, a portion of the Ubuntu dock or side panel gets tucked under the Activities overview. Although this may not be a serious issue, you can work around it by adjusting the dock position or turning off "Panel Mode" in appearance settings.

##  Auto-Hide the Top Bar and Dock in Ubuntu

 By default, the "Hide Top Bar" extension is already set to auto-hide the top bar. You don't need to modify any settings, just install and enable the extension. It will auto-hide the top bar whenever a window approaches it. You can modify these default settings from the "Intellihide" section.

![Intellihide settings menu with the first option enabled](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/11-4.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 To auto-hide the dock, right-click on the desktop and select "Display Settings."

![Ubuntu Desktop context menu with display settings option highlighted](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/12-5.png) 

 Inside the "Display" settings, navigate to "Appearance" and enable the "Auto-hide the Dock" option.

![System Appearance settings with auto hide dock option enabled](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/13-3.png) 

 That's it, now the dock will auto-hide when you drag a window near it.
