 However, there seem to be doubts about using ChatGPT on a Mac. Most people search for ChatGPT on the Mac App Store and install one of the initial results. But, as recent reports suggest, it's a habit you must stay away from.

## Shady ChatGPT Apps Are Flooding the App Store

 Apple recommends the Mac App Store as one of the safest ways to download and install apps. It is true most of the time as well. However, following the dramatic popularity of ChatGPT, developers are flooding the Mac App Store with shady and buggy ChatGPT apps. Many of these apps also have elements that are frequently used to scam users.

 This problematic side of the Mac App Store was unearthed in [Alex Kleber's Medium post](https://privacyis1st.medium.com/the-dark-side-of-the-mac-app-store-how-scam-apps-and-shady-developers-are-preying-on-users-b28062642e6). The author discovered that the popular results for terms like ChatGPT and OpenAI are fraudulent apps that do not deliver what they promise.

 For instance, many apps are either blocked by a paywall or do not work whatsoever. While some apps work for the first few minutes, you are presented with an in-app purchase pop-up on the screen.

 Further research on the issue also indicated that most of these problematic "ChatGPT" apps come from similar or the same developers. Therefore, the author believes these apps are part of a scam network that wants to capitalize on the increasing demand for GPT-style services.

 To create a sense of legitimacy, these apps reuse the logo and design elements of OpenAI and ChatGPT. It happens even though OpenAI does not have a native ChatGPT app for macOS

 While only Apple can do something about mitigating this issue of problematic apps, you must stay far away from these ChatGPT apps on the Mac App Store.

## How to Safely Use ChatGPT on a Mac

 Despite the abundance of shady ChatGPT apps, there are two ways to access ChatGPT from your Mac safely.

### 1\. Use the Web Interface

 The web interface of OpenAI is the safest way to use ChatGPT on your Mac. Considering that OpenAI has not yet developed a native app for macOS, Windows, iOS, or Android, the web interface seems to be the best option for most people.

 And while [ChatGPT has problems](https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/), the web app works fine almost always. You can access the web interface of OpenAI's ChatGPT by visiting [chat.openai.com](http://www.chat.openai.com).

 You need to register for an account if you don't already have one. OpenAI also lets you [choose between the free and paid versions of ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-plus-subscription-worth-it/).

### 2\. Use MacGPT

 If you want a more native experience with ChatGPT on your Mac, you should check out MacGPT. It's one of the few legitimate apps that help you integrate ChatGPT into your Mac. For instance, you can make MacGPT work as a macOS menu bar app.

 This menu bar interface will help you interact with ChatGPT without needing to open a separate browser window. The same app enables you to seek the help of ChatGPT with various text fields and even the Spotlight Search interface. With just a trigger word, you can let ChatGPT do all the typing.

 We should mention that the setup requires more than signing into your OpenAI account. To set up the MacGPT app on your Mac, you need to create a ChatGPT API key from the OpenAI website and paste it into the app's home screen. Our [complete guide to ChatGPT APIs](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-api-complete-guide/) will help you do it.

 You can download MacGPT from its official website. However, you'll likely need ChatGPT Plus to get the best experience from the app.
