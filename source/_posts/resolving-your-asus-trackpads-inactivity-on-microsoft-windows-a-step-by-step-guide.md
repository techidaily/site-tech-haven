 Don’t know how to set up a VPN connection on your Mac? Don’t worry! It’s pretty easy! After reading this article, you should be able to use VPN on your macOS devices on your own quickly and easily!

## What is VPN?

**VPN (Virtual Personal Network)**   is a type of connection you can use to secure your identity and protect your personal information when surfing the Internet.

 VPN creates a secure “tube” to connect your Mac to the Internet. Once you connected to a VPN server, all the activities on your Mac will be encrypted. So hackers cannot steal your personal information, and your privacy won’t be revealed to your government and your ISP (Internet Service Provider).
