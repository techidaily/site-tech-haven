## iPad Pro (7th generation)

Apple

Apple's new iPad Pro most notably features a performance jump, thanks to moving from an M2 chip to a [new M4 chip](https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-ipad-pros-new-outrageously-powerful-m4-chip-designed-for-ai-workloads/), which the company says delivers up to 4x faster GPU rendering and a 50% faster CPU performance than the M2 in the previous iPad Pro.

Once again, the tablet comes in two sizes (11 inches and 13 inches), and both are thinner than previous versions (the 13-inch iPad Pro is Apple's thinnest product yet, at 5.1mm).
