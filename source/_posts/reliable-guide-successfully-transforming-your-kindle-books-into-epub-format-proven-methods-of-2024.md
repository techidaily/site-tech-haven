Converting Kindle ebooks to ePub format is an indispensable step when we use epub-supported eReaders instead of Kindle devices. Among so many eBook readers, we might not take Kindle preferably. However, among so many eBook stores, books from Amazon Kindle generally come at a remarkably cheaper price and of far more diversified genres. Since Kindle books are formatted as exclusive AZW/MOBI/PRC/TPZ/KFX, we cannot directly read them on iPad, Nook, Kobo, Sony Reader, BlackBerry Playbook and other devices. This guide will show you how to convert Kindle books, mainly Kindle .azw formats, to EPUB for the best reading on non-Kindle gadgets.

![convert Kindle to Epub for Windows](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle-epub-converter.jpg)

Some people might be confused about why would they need this tool, since there are many freeware or online converters out there. However, nearly all purchased Kindle books (.azw/.kfx) are protected by Kindle DRM, which are not supported by those converters. There is indeed some software with DeDRM plugins out there, but personally, none of them is convenient enough. Here we convert purchased Kindle books to Epub by using **_[Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)_**, which is capable of removing DRM and converting ebook formats.

Below are the steps to convert Kindle ebooks to ePub with the best kindle2epub converter tool named Epubor Ultimate. Note that kindle unlimited books are not supported. 

### Part 1\. Convert AZW to EPUB via latest Kindle for PC/Mac

For a long time, we had to downgrade our Kindle for PC/Mac to an older version to successfully decode or convert Kindle ebooks. But now, I'm glad to tell you that Epubor has finally managed to provide the solution. 

#### Step 1\. Download and install [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/). 

[](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

#### Step 2\. Install the latest version of Kindle for PC/Mac and download Kindle books to your PC/Mac.

[_Kindle for PC V2.4.0 Download_](https://download.epubor.com/KindleForPC-installer-2.4.0-70904.exe
) [_Kindle for Mac V1.40 Download_](https://download.epubor.com/KindleForMac-installer-1.40.dmg)

To download Kindle books, click the kindle ebook cover to download it.

![downloa kindle books](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/download-kindle-books-new-kindle-app-1.png)

#### Step 3\. Remove Kindle DRM 2023\. 

Launch Epubor Ultimate, all Kindle books downloaded via the Kindle app will show up under the Kindle tab. Select all the Kindle titles and drag and drop them to the right main window to remove DRM. 

![remove kindle drm](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/remove-kindle-drm-2023-new.png)

To Mac computer users: You should use the [Kindle for Mac desktop app](https://download.epubor.com/KindleForMac-installer-1.40.dmg) to help download your kindle books. Don't use the Kindle app from App store. 

#### Step 4\. Convert Kindle to epub output. 

Select EPUB as the output format and hit the convert button. After the conversion, it says Succeeded to the right of the book title. You will find the epub file by clicking Succeeded. 

![convert kindle to epub](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-kindle-to-epub-new.png)

### Dealing with Kindle KCR format on Mac computer

When using the latest Kindle for Mac to download Kindle books, you may encounter the**[Kindle KCR format](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)** on Mac. In such cases, you have two options: using 'Download and transfer via USB' if you have a physical Kindle device or using 'Kindle Converter'.

![kindle kcr format](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle-kcr-format-2023.png)

Don't have any kindle device? Please don't worry. Try [**Epubor Kindle Converter**](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/kindle-converter/)\--the NO.1 software to remove and convert kindle books published in 2023 or the Kindle kcr format on Mac.

#### Convert Kindle to ePub with Calibre? 

If we use caliber to convert kindle books to ePub, we should also install dedrm plugins in caliber. Compared to Calibre, [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) is much easier to use, with easy conversion, simple user interface, and excellent customer support. When comes to handle the latest kindle for PC/Mac, Epubor Ultimate is the only option.

![epubor ultimo confronto calibre](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ultimate-convert-fast.jpg)

As ePub is a widely supported eBook format, now you can even read those books via Apple Book App as well. 

I've been looking for a long time for a program that can convert Kindle books into epub files. After testing the program, I was more than happy with the converted files. You can convert so many books with it, so reading great books never ends so quickly.

Hey,

 Sure the process seems easy but where do I find these kindle books?? Where is the folder?

 For your information, I downloaded the books via PC from amazon and can view and Download&pin via kindle cloud reader, but I cannot find the ebooks anywhere on my PC.

 If I cannot even find it, it completely defeats the 'usefulness' of this application.

Hi,

 If you download your books via Kindle for PC, they are always saved in the default folder: ...Users\\Administrator\\Documents\\My Kindle Content.

 If you can not find them, you can try to click Tools--&gt;Options--&gt;Content on your Kindle for PC to find your Kindle current content folder.

 Thanks.

Thanks to ePubor Ultimate an old iPad running iOS 9.2 is a useful tool again! It's replaced my kindle as my main & preferred reading device. The ability to move my books over is worth every penny! Thank you! I meant to leave 5 Star rating, but I clicked in the wrong place and it wouldn't let me change it.

Is this really going to work?? All my kindle books are multiple (3) .ASC files .. and ENDAUCTION..., STARTAUCTION ... and an XRAY... .ASC files. So which one do you choose, because there is no .azw or.kfx file. I suspect this is no longer working.

Have to pay or jump through hoops to actually have the file converted. I just wasted hours setting up and converting books only to test on my reader that they're just "buy our license for the actual file" gobblety gook. What a waste.

Waste of time. Website says nothing about purchasing a license. After going throught the download and install process, it is then you have to buy a license. Just for that reason, I'm using something else.

I have 134 Kindle books - from over many years, all on a MB Pro, and, on a iPad Max. Most helped with research so ePub is a better research app. So, I want to be able to have access to the files using Kindle as that is a fine "just sit down and read" app. Should I copy the entire Kindle file and place it in a separate file using an name mod (to avoid cnofusing Kindle when I want to use that) maybe calling the new file "epub" and then convert the copied files?

This has worked for me for ages... Except today. One of my newer books that I purchased (and those that have issues purchasing a book need to have a talk with themselves about authors deserving payment for their work), seems to need a newer version of the Kindle for PC app. I tried downloading it, but it would not download on the older Kindle app. and Epubor did recognize it, but it could not extract a file I could convert... Any help would be appreciated.

Clarification if needed:  
 Steps for Issue: 

 Current Kindle Version 1.32.0  
 Select Download for Book (The Commander's Fate, B.A. Stretke)3

 Window Popup: Item not available for this device type  
 Your Kindle app requires an update to view this content. (Linked words) Click here to download and install the free update (supported OS: Windows 10, Windows 8).

 So I downloaded the update (forgetting the specific need for the downgraded app), Downloaded the book. Opened Epubor and it recognized the book. I dragged it over, and it could not decrypt.

 I was suggested to downgrade Kindle app, and I did. But could not download the content as it suggested upgrading the app again.

Hello, thanks for your comment.

 The free trial version of Epubor Ultimate only helps you decrypt and convert 20% of the books in TXT format (images not included). Once you purchase the software and register it with your license, you will get the complete book converted with all the images and in the proper format you want like PDF/Epub/Mobi/AZW3/TXT.

 If you're still interested in our Epubor software, please feel free to contact us via support@epubor.com, we can offer you an exclusive discount.

This is crap. Do not waste your money. Epubor knows that now you cannot downgrade your kindle app for PC and download the necessary format from Amazon, and now all formats are now KFX format. Only the older version of Kindle allowed you to download the AZW format, but you cannot do it now. Even if you have an older version of the Kindle software, you cannot download ANY book without updating, and that update makes conversions of the Kindle content impossible, rendering Epubor useless. And Epubor knows this. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. This does NOT work.
