On Monday, Apple announced the [Apple Watch Series 10](https://www.zdnet.com/article/buying-an-apple-watch-series-10-consider-these-3-features-before-upgrading/) at the ["It's Glowtime" event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-we-expect-at-apples-iphone-16-event-ai-features-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-more/) in Cupertino, California. The new Apple Watch features the largest display and thinnest design yet, Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the event. It's also the fastest-charging Apple Watch, getting you up to 80% battery in 30 minutes, Apple says. In terms of features, the Series 10 includes sleep apnea detection for the first time and an impressive 18-hour battery life.

The Apple Watch Series 10 offers two bigger sizes (42mm and 46mm) and a slim design, which should make it more comfortable to wear on your wrist. You can opt for an aluminum or titanium display (the titanium has a more durable sapphire crystal display), along with new matching loops. The [Apple Watch Ultra 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-the-apple-watch-ultra-2-is-a-near-perfect-wearable-for-me-and-its-100-off-for-labor-day/) also got a new colorway in satin black, though no other changes.
