## How to Enroll in ChatGPT Plugin Upgrades Now

 ChatGPT, the language model developed by OpenAI, is set to introduce a new feature: plugins. These plugins enhance ChatGPT's capabilities by enabling it to access external tools and information not included in its training data, connecting the generative AI to the internet.

 ChatGPT's plugins aren't yet available, but you can sign-up to become one of the first users to take them for a spin.

 On March 19, 2024,[OpenAI disabled ChatGPT Plugin](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8988022-winding-down-the-chatgpt-plugins-beta) conversations and completely removed them on April 9, 2024\. ChatGPT Plugins were removed because much of their functionality can be found in[custom GPTs and the GPT Store](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-custom-gpt-store/) .

 ChatGPT plugins are software components integrated into[the ChatGPT platform](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/) . They provide ChatGPT with additional information, such as up-to-date news or data from proprietary sources, and enable ChatGPT to perform specific actions on behalf of users.

 Plugins can also help ChatGPT overcome some limitations of large language models, such as[AI "hallucinations"](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-hallucination-and-how-do-you-spot-it/) or the inability to keep up with recent events.

 For example, suppose you want to use ChatGPT to write an email to your boss. You could ask ChatGPT to generate a draft for you, but it might not know the latest updates on your project or the best way to address your boss. With plugins, you could connect ChatGPT to your email client, calendar, and project management tool.

 Then, ChatGPT could use these plugins to fetch relevant information and insert them into the email draft. It could also use the plugins to send emails, schedule a meeting, or update a task's status.
