 Here are 4 fixes for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.

 **Method 1:[Check Skype Heartbeat](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 2:[Upgrade Skype to the latest version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
