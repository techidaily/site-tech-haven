## How to Securely Transfer Windows 11 Documents in Just Seven Steps

To those who have ever experienced the pain of losing data, backing up your important files and folders is a must especially when you have important information stored in your computer. When it comes to data and information, you can never have too many backups stored in different places.

 Backing up your files is also a crucial move when you are about to perform a Refresh or a Reset of your Windows 10, since the refresh or reset could delete some of the folders or files that you don’t want to lose.

 If you trust a certain backup tool, you can use it to help you with the back up for sure. If you cannot find a trustworthy backup tool, don’t worry, Windows 10 have already taken care of it for you. All you need is a USB flash drive or a valid network shared or network attached drive.

 Here is how you can backup your files and folders by using only the help from Windows.

 1) Click the**Start** button, then choose**Settings** from the list of choice.
