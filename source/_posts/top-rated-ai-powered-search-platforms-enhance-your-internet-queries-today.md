 Claude is trained on a meticulously filtered dataset, ensuring harmful content exclusion, and Anthropic consistently monitors Claude’s performance to mitigate safety risks. Furthermore,[Anthropic has confirmed](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8114494-how-up-to-date-is-claude-s-training-data) Claude's training data cut-off point is December 2022, but "may know some events into early 2023." Claude's up-to-date information gives it an advantage over ChatGPT's data cut-off point of September 2021, which is one of the reasons[Claude is better than ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-claude-ai-chatbot-better-than-chatgpt/) .
