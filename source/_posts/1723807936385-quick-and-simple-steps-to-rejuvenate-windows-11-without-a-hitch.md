## Quick & Simple Steps to Rejuvenate Windows 11 Without a Hitch

 A**refresh on Windows 10** will help you reinstall Windows 10\. However, it will**remove** the applications and drivers that you have installed and your personal settings will be changed back to default as well. It will also remove applications from your computer manufacturer but the apps you installed from the Windows store will remain.

 A**reset on Windows 10** will help you reinstall Windows 10 and removes**ALL** your personal files.
