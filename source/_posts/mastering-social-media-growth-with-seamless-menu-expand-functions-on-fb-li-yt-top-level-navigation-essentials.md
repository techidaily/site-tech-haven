## Mastering Social Media Growth with Seamless Menu Expand Functions on FB, LI, YT - Top-Level Navigation Essentials

Although we create Copernic with the user in mind and believe it is user-friendly and intuitive, there are some tricks some of our more experienced users follow that our newer users may not be aware of.

 You are likely aware of the Search bar on the main page of the program; it is here you input the key words for the file(s) you’re seeking. However, you might not be aware that you can specify the type of file you need in the drop-down menu in the Search option.

 It is also possible to save your preferred settings in your MySearches. In your refinement menu, select the file type (or refinement of your choosing,) in the Search drop-down menu, the search settings will display at the bottom of the page. You may name it according to your needs and settings.

 If you have search options listed here you do not need, you may also delete or rename existing settings by right clicking on the category you’d like to remove or rename.

 In the Tools menu, under options, you may customize your preferred indexing options. In this example, we can select which of our email files are indexed when the software runs. You may make similar customizations in OneDrive, SharePoint, Teams, etc. This will reduce the number of files to be indexed and will free your system to locate files you actually need.

 You also have the option of refining your search and adding a refinement on the main page of the program. If you are looking for a particular type of file, the file type icons along the bar next to the refinement menu will allow you to narrow down your search. Each option has its own refinement menu as well, all to help make your search quick and easy! Our blog article discussing refining a search is available[here](https://tools.techidaily.com/) .

 Using the search bar is the first step in your Copernic experience. By using these shortcuts, you can have Copernic work even faster to find the files you need and save you valuable time.
