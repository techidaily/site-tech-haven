Doing so would make it possible to find the lost remote using your iPhone, iPad or another Apple device. </p><p>But that hope was soon removed once the Apple TV 4K was released, with no Find My support in sight. Since then, my kids and I have lost our Siri Remote at least 1,334 times. Sure, most of the time, it’s between the couch cushions, but there are random instances of someone walking off to a different room with it, resulting in a few hours of accusations and searching. </p><p><a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/siri-remote-airtag-case-ashland-brown"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/2022/06/02/644556b0-7119-4a8b-922f-d8b2f50d8cee/leather-cover-for-siri-remote-and-airtag.jpg"                      alt="leather-cover-for-siri-remote-and-airtag.jpg"                > Nomad Leather Cover for Siri Remote and AirTag</a> </p><h4 id="pros-and-cons"><a href="#pros-and-cons" class="headerlink" title="pros and cons"></a>pros and cons</h4><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Leather material</li><li>Comfortable</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Adds bulk to the Siri Remote</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/siri-remote-airtag-case-ashland-brown" >$39.95 at Nomad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>However, Nomad’s latest leather-bound accessory fixes that problem. The aptly named <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/siri-remote-airtag-case-ashland-brown" >Leather Cover for Siri Remote &amp; AirTag <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is exactly what its name implies – a leather case for the remote that also has a spot to hold one of Apple’s <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airtag/airtag/1-pack?fnode=b503651715b41d22c739fcbf9de19d440fbb95fe5d6570ba6182f18687144c2be2c39faf24ca95d37ab5a9e5aaeaac92981cf2591dcc5f1e861f1781cb4ac4bd285516675143fcd28efd1040a6bd9b8c318107c4ad5ae22a3e79ca948bcee3ad&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >AirTags <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>The AirTag is hidden in a compartment that’s underneath the remote. The inside of the cover is lined with a soft microfiber material that won’t scratch the remote or the AirTag. </p><p>There are cutouts on the three sides of the cover. One in the front, another on the side for the Siri button and one on the bottom to give you access to the Lightning charge port. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-record-a-phone-call-on-your-iphone/" >How to record a phone call on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>After unboxing the review sample Nomad sent me, one of my concerns was that the AirTag was covered up enough that any sounds to help in locating the remote would be muted. However, after a few tests, I can confirm that the AirTag’s location sounds are still loud enough to find the remote, whether it’s sitting on a counter or underneath the couch. </p><p>To be clear, the cover doesn’t come with an AirTag. You’ll need to provide one. You can find AirTag’s on <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX532AM-A-AirTag/dp/B0933BVK6T?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C87958d72-f80f-4a50-b300-a9353a6b00a3%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Amazon for $29 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>My lone complaint, which was echoed by my family, is how much bulk the case adds to the Siri Remote. This isn’t technically Nomad’s fault because the company had to make the case deep enough to hold the AirTag and cover the sides of the remote. I’m sure after a few days of use, we won’t even notice the cover, and it’ll be a non-issue. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/siri-remote-airtag-case-ashland-brown" >Nomad Leather Cover For Siri Remote &amp; AirTag $33.95 at Nomad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If your family is like mine and you constantly lose the Apple TV remote, you can order Nomad’s Leather Cover for Siri Remote and AirTag for <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/siri-remote-airtag-case-ashland-brown" >$39.95 right now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

And if that doesn’t stop it, the case includes magnets to stick it to the side of your TV, or there’s a lanyard in the box as well. You know, in case you want to wear your Apple TV remote around the house. </p><h4 id="Featured-reviews"><a href="#Featured-reviews" class="headerlink" title="Featured reviews"></a>Featured

Apple just announced three new Apple Watch models — the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-se&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Apple Watch SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Apple Watch Series 8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-ultra&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Apple Watch Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>Each Apple Watch model was designed with specific users in mind. The Apple Watch SE, for example, is perfect for someone who doesn’t want to spend a lot on a smartwatch, or for a parent who wants to be able to get in touch with a child using <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211768" >Apple’s Family Setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. </p><p><strong>Review: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-8-review/" >Apple Watch Series 8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>And then there’s the Apple Watch Series 8 and the Apple Watch Ultra. The watches have two completely different designs but have a lot of features that overlap, such as the new temperature sensor, women’s health features and crash detection, along with the staple ECG, fall detection and blood oxygen features. So which one should you get? Well, the decision may be easier than you think. Let’s break it down. </p><p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-8-vs-apple-watch-series-7/"><strong>Apple Watch Series 8 vs. Apple Watch Series 7: Which is best for you</strong>?</a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h2><p>| |  Apple Watch Ultra | Apple Watch Series 8                                                            |                                                                         |<br>| ——————– | ——————————————————————————- | ———————————————————————– |<br>| Processor            | S8 64-bit dual-core processor, W3 wireless chip, U1 ultra-wideband chip         | S8 64-bit dual-core processor, W3 wireless chip, U1 ultra-wideband chip |<br>| Display              | 49mm always-on Retina display with 2,000 nits brightness                        | 41mm or 45mm always-on Retina display with 1,000 nits brightness        |<br>| Rating               | IP6X dust resistant, 100m water resistance, EN13319 certification, MIL-STD 810H | IP6X dust resistant, 50m water resistance                               |<br>| Battery life         | Up to 36 hours                                                                  | Up to 18 hours                                                          |<br>| Connectivity         | Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Cellular, L1 and L5 GPS                                       | Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Cellular, GPS                                         |<br>| Colors               | Titanium                                                                        | Midnight, Starlight, Silver, Product(Red)                               |<br>| Starting price       | $799                                                                            | $399                                                                    |</p><hr><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-Apple-Watch-Ultra-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-Apple-Watch-Ultra-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the Apple Watch Ultra if…"></a>You should buy the Apple Watch Ultra if…</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/2106658/12108" target="_top" id="2106658">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-2106658" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/2106658/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-You’re-ready-for-a-new-Apple-Watch-design"><a href="#1-You’re-ready-for-a-new-Apple-Watch-design" class="headerlink" title="1. You’re ready for a new Apple Watch design"></a>1. You’re ready for a new Apple Watch design</h3><p>The Apple Watch Ultra has mostly the same design language as a traditional Apple Watch, but with a modern flair. Instead of the display sitting on the top of the housing, it’s now recessed in the titanium body to help protect it. On the right side of the housing is the familiar Digital Crown and side button that’s been on every Apple Watch model, but they, too, are protected by the titanium housing. </p><p>On the left side of the watch is a new Action button that’s easy to spot because of its bright orange color. The Action button is customizable, making it possible to assign tasks of your choosing such as begin a workout, launch a Shortcut or mark a waypoint during a hike. This extra button is not available on the Apple Watch Series 8. </p><p>The 49mm housing is also the biggest Apple Watch made to date, and with double the brightness of the Series 8, the screen is sure to be easy to see in all conditions – including direct sunlight. </p><p>With a new design comes new bands, as well. There are <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-apple-watch-ultra-bands-work-with-other-apple-watch-models-too/" >three completely new watchband designs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, each one designed for different activities such as outdoor adventures, endurance training and water sports. </p><h3 id="2-You-ride-hike-or-dive…-a-lot"><a href="#2-You-ride-hike-or-dive…-a-lot" class="headerlink" title="2. You ride, hike or dive… a lot"></a>2. You ride, hike or dive… a lot</h3><p>Speaking of outdoor activities, the Ultra is specifically made for extreme fitness enthusiasts who need longer battery life, a better, brighter display and improved GPS tracking. </p><p>Apple touts 36 hours of battery life for the Ultra during normal use, or 60 hours when you activate low power mode. The Ultra is compatible with two different GPS frequencies, L1 and L5, which should provide <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-l5-precision-dual-frequency-gps-why-is-apple-using-it-and-do-you-need-it" >accurate and precise location information <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> regardless of your surroundings. The new compass app will track your route during a hike or bike ride, and then provide waypoints for you to find your way back – should you get lost. </p><p>Every Apple Watch Ultra comes with LTE capabilities, so as long as you pay your wireless carrier for an additional plan (usually around $10 a month), your watch will always be connected, even if you leave your iPhone behind. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027190/19272" target="_top" id="2027190">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027190" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027190/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-You-need-a-ruggedized-watch"><a href="#3-You-need-a-ruggedized-watch" class="headerlink" title="3. You need a ruggedized watch"></a>3. You need a ruggedized watch</h3><p>As for ruggedness, the Ultra has a long list of certifications – most of which I had no idea existed until now. For instance, the Ultra is EN13319 certified, which is a widely recognized standard for dive computers and depth gauges. There’s a depth sensor built into the watch itself so it’ll know when you’re diving and automatically adjust to the environment. Its water resistance is rated at 100 meters, which goes toe to toe with <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-sports-watch/" >actual sport watches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>The Ultra is also MIL-STD 810H certified for harsh conditions and temperatures, with Apple claiming it’ll work in temperatures ranging from -20 degrees Celsius to 55 degrees Celsius. </p><p>There’s even an 86-decibel siren built into the watch should you need emergency help. Apple claims the siren can be heard up to 600 feet away. </p><p><strong>More: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-price-release-date-features-colors-everything-you-need-to-know/" >Apple Watch Ultra: Price, release date, and features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-ultra&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Apple Watch Ultra $799 at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-Apple-Watch-Series-8-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-Apple-Watch-Series-8-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the Apple Watch Series 8 if…"></a>You should buy the Apple Watch Series 8 if…</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126492/26400" target="_top" id="2126492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126492/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-You-want-a-traditional-Apple-Watch-design"><a href="#1-You-want-a-traditional-Apple-Watch-design" class="headerlink" title="1. You want a traditional Apple Watch design"></a>1. You want a traditional Apple Watch design</h3><p>If the Apple Watch Ultra’s design isn’t all that appealing to you, the Apple Watch Series 8 may be the better choice. It uses the same design as the last few Apple Watch models and comes in 41mm and 45mm sizes. On the right side of the aluminum (or steel) housing is the digital crown and side button that’s used for navigating the watch. </p><p>If you have an older Apple Watch, your watch bands will work on the Series 8 without any issues (assuming you get the same sized watch). And, if you happen to like the new Ultra watch bands and have a 44mm or 45mm Apple Watch, you can buy and use one of the new Ultra bands on the Series 8. </p><p>The Series 8 is available in four aluminum colors this year. There’s Starlight, Midnight, Silver and Product Red. The stainless steel models come in Gold, Graphite and Space Black. </p><p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-apple-watch-ultra-bands-work-with-other-apple-watch-models-too/"><strong>New Apple Watch Ultra bands work with other Apple Watch models, too</strong></a></p><h3 id="2-You’re-not-ready-to-pay-799-for-a-watch"><a href="#2-You’re-not-ready-to-pay-799-for-a-watch" class="headerlink" title="2.

You’re not ready to pay $799 for a watch</h3><p>The Apple Watch SE is the most affordable watch in Apple’s lineup, with models <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-se&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >starting at $249 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. However, it lacks some of the key health features that the Series 8 and Ultra have – such as ECG and blood oxygen level monitoring. </p><p>The Series 8 <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >starts at $399 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which isn’t exactly cheap, but it’s more affordable than the Ultra’s <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-ultra&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >$799 price tag <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>For $399 you can get a <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >41mm Apple Watch Series 8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or for $429 you can pick up a <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >45mm Apple Watch Series 8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Both of those prices are for an aluminum body and lack cellular connectivity. If you want to add cellular capabilities, you’ll pay a $100 premium – bringing the total to $499 and $529, respectively. </p><p>Still, those prices are more affordable than the Ultra’s price tag and the Series 8 is sure to last a few years, or at least until Apple stops providing software updates to it. </p><h3 id="3-Don’t-need-all-of-the-extreme-outdoor-features"><a href="#3-Don’t-need-all-of-the-extreme-outdoor-features" class="headerlink" title="3. Don’t need all of the extreme outdoor features"></a>3. Don’t need all of the extreme outdoor features</h3><p>Even if you like the design of the Ultra, it has more features than I’d wager most people will ever need. Two different types of GPS tracking, the ability to withstand a depth of 100m underwater, and the 2,000 nits display for outdoor viewing can all be overkill. </p><p>With the Series 8, you’re still getting a watch that’s more than capable of tracking your regular exercise and workouts, your sleep, and now, with the added temperature sensor, you can even view your body’s temperature while you sleep. And for women, this plays into <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-8-body-temperature-sensor-ovulation-cycles-tracking/" >reproductive health <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>The Series 8 is water resistant, as well, and can be used while swimming or even surfing in the ocean. It does all of the core Apple Watch fitness things that the Apple Watch has done for years – that hasn’t changed. </p><p><strong>More: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >The best Apple Watch models of 2022 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Apple Watch Series 8 $399 at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094479/7443" target="_top" id="2094479">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094479" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094479/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Alternatives-to-consider"><a href="#Alternatives-to-consider" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to consider"></a>Alternatives to consider</h2><p>Open to other Apple Watch prospects?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Revolutionizing-Online-Content-Unveiling-Eight-Major-Impacts-of-Artificial-Intelligence-Chatbots"><a href="#Revolutionizing-Online-Content-Unveiling-Eight-Major-Impacts-of-Artificial-Intelligence-Chatbots" class="headerlink" title="Revolutionizing Online Content: Unveiling Eight Major Impacts of Artificial Intelligence Chatbots"></a>Revolutionizing Online Content: Unveiling Eight Major Impacts of Artificial Intelligence Chatbots</h2><p> Regardless of your opinions on AI chatbots, you can’t deny their massive impact on the content industry. Probably every writer has heard about them. Global tech giants made headlines by releasing AI-driven chatbots, e.g., ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google Bard.</p><p> Despite AI being innovative, it isn’t always beneficial. Here are some ways AI chatbots have been positive and negative for professionals in the content industry.</p><h2 id="1-AI-Minimizes-Grammatical-Errors"><a href="#1-AI-Minimizes-Grammatical-Errors" class="headerlink" title="1. AI Minimizes Grammatical Errors"></a>1. AI Minimizes Grammatical Errors</h2><p> AI chatbots have come a long way from producing incoherent text. Nowadays, advanced LLMs produce grammatically correct outputs on any topic under the sun. You could even ask them to adopt a specific tone.</p><p> Apart from producing grammatically correct text, chatbots assist with edits and corrections. Many professionals use them as free alternatives to grammar checkers. LLMs can spot grammatical errors, text inconsistencies, run-on sentences, misspelled words, and awkward phrasing.</p><p>The below image shows ChatGPT suggesting text corrections.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-spotting-spelling-errors.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT to Edit Text and Spot Grammar Errors"                ></p><p> Bing Chat provides more accurate results by referencing other grammar checkers in real-time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bing-chat-edits-text.jpg"                      alt="Bing Chat Edits Paragraphs by Quillbot&#39;s Standards "                ></p><p> You’ll find many<a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-grammar-checker/" >reliable grammar checkers online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but full-suite plans often come with monthly subscriptions. Free accounts get limited checks. On Grammarly, users can’t even unlock advanced suggestions until they upgrade to a Premium plan.</p><h2 id="2-Poorly-Researched-Articles-Spread-Misinformation"><a href="#2-Poorly-Researched-Articles-Spread-Misinformation" class="headerlink" title="2. Poorly Researched Articles Spread Misinformation"></a>2. Poorly Researched Articles Spread Misinformation</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >One of the biggest problems with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Bing Chat, among other platforms, is that they don’t double-check facts. They merely present what they know. ChatGPT formulates answers from datasets, and Bing Chat runs search queries, but neither performs fact-checking.</p><p> For instance, the below photo shows that ChatGPT doesn’t know its own launch date.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-stating-incorrect-information.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Answering Question About Itself Wrong"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027176/19272" target="_top" id="2027176">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027176" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027176/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Despite these limitations, some writers wholly depend on ChatGPT for topic research. They want quick, convenient answers. However, you can’t replace proper research with AI chatbot conversations. You’ll end up publishing incorrect information.</p><p> Many shady AI writers actually draw flak for spreading misinformation. Only use chatbots for preliminary research. Ask them to break down complex subjects before diving into academic journals and scholarly papers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141676/17091" target="_top" id="2141676">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2141676" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141676/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Generic-AI-Generated-Articles-Flood-SERPs"><a href="#3-Generic-AI-Generated-Articles-Flood-SERPs" class="headerlink" title="3. Generic AI-Generated Articles Flood SERPs"></a>3. Generic AI-Generated Articles Flood SERPs</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/google-search-results-on-smartphone.jpg"                      alt="Google Analytics Google Search Results on a Smartphone"                ></p><p> Unfortunately, you’ll find AI content ranking on Google. AI writers use the time and effort they save to improve their SEO, boosting page visibility. Some of them even utilize backlinks to fake authoritativeness.</p><p> SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages) are flooded with low-effort AI content that comprises generic, simplistic insights. They touch on topics but never explain them. Readers only gain a basic, surface-level understanding of subjects from these articles.</p><p> The upside is that Google rewards well-researched content. Googlebot eventually replaces ranking AI articles that provide no added value to readers. Even results on page one could quickly drop. Just keep publishing quality pieces. You could also brush up on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tips-to-write-for-google-helpful-content-update/" >Google’s helpful content guide update <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to write even better.</p><h2 id="4-Marketers-Revamp-Their-SEO-Strategies"><a href="#4-Marketers-Revamp-Their-SEO-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="4. Marketers Revamp Their SEO Strategies"></a>4. Marketers Revamp Their SEO Strategies</h2><p> SEO tools often come with a steep price tag. Widely used options like<a class="link"   href="https://ahrefs.com/" >Ahrefs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://semrush.sjv.io/c/119570/995972/13053?subId1=UUmuoUeUpU2024741&subId2=emuo&u=https://www.semrush.com/" >Semrush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> could set you back by hundreds a month. The fees don’t make sense unless you run all their features.</p><p> If you need basic SEO keyword research and analytics, use AI chatbots instead. We suggest Bing Chat since it’s connected to the internet. It references popular SEO tools to give you real-time SEO analytics.</p><p>The below image shows Bing Chat’s keyword research on AI.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bing-chat-doing-seo-keyword-research.jpg"                      alt="Bing Chat Suggesting Keywords Based on Your Topic"                ></p><p> Since Bing Chat wasn’t designed for SEO research, you must phrase your prompts properly. Don’t just say you need SEO analytics. Ask for specific data, like top-ranking LSI keywords, search volume analytics, and market trends.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2148127/17093" target="_top" id="2148127">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2148127" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2148127/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Content-Mills-Publish-AI-Generated-Articles-in-Masses"><a href="#5-Content-Mills-Publish-AI-Generated-Articles-in-Masses" class="headerlink" title="5.

But with the availability of AI-driven chatbots, they further sped up the writing process at no extra cost. It’s common for them to publish hundreds of AI content daily.</p><p> Most mills work around plagiarism and copyright infringement laws by hiring human editors. They pay chump change for quick, low-effort edits. Their sole purpose is to alter outputs so that their clients don’t flag them for plagiarism.</p><p> Avoid content mills like the plague. They pay industry-low rates, set unrealistic output expectations, and place zero value on quality writing. Your writing career won’t progress while working for them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135398/19272" target="_top" id="2135398">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135398" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135398/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Plagiarism-Has-Become-More-Widespread"><a href="#6-Plagiarism-Has-Become-More-Widespread" class="headerlink" title="6. Plagiarism Has Become More Widespread"></a>6. Plagiarism Has Become More Widespread</h2><p> Plagiarism has become more widespread recently. Remember: AI repeats answers. So if multiple writers were to discuss one topic, their articles would share the same angle, structure, outline, and theme. Some writers rephrase texts to avoid getting flagged for plagiarism.</p><p> But since they also use publicly available paraphrasing tools, Google still detects their template outputs. Their sites quickly lose authority afterwards. You can’t cheat the system. To produce original pieces with unique insights, research various official and non-official sources.</p><h2 id="7-More-Articles-Share-Similar-Angles"><a href="#7-More-Articles-Share-Similar-Angles" class="headerlink" title="7. More Articles Share Similar Angles"></a>7. More Articles Share Similar Angles</h2><p> AI chatbots produce template responses. They pull information from the exact datasets even if you regenerate responses several times. Take the below conversation as an example. This photo shows ChatGPT answering a general knowledge question about AI.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-answers-general-knowledge-question-about-ai.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Answering a Basic Question General Kowledge Question About AI"                ></p><p> We started a new chat and reused our prompt, but ChatGPT provided identical facts. It only rephrased its output.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-answering-a-regenerated-question-about-ai.jpg"                      alt="Trying to Get ChatGPT to Answer the Same Question About AI"                ></p><p> Since chatbots generate the same information, writers publishing AI-generated content end up sharing angles. Many even follow similar article structures.</p><p> Ultimately, the lack of variation and originality triggers plagiarism offenses. Your site’s ranking will quickly drop, and visitors won’t bother reading your blogs if they’ve already seen them elsewhere.</p><h2 id="8-AI-Chatbots-Commodify-Subpar-Content"><a href="#8-AI-Chatbots-Commodify-Subpar-Content" class="headerlink" title="8. AI Chatbots Commodify Subpar Content"></a>8. AI Chatbots Commodify Subpar Content</h2><p> As content mills bombard readers with AI-generated pieces, other publications are forced to fight back. Even global media publishers invest in writing tools nowadays. Some use them ironically, while others churn out content to stay relevant.</p><p> To make matters worse, fake gurus encourage unsuspecting newbies to exploit AI-driven platforms. They make the practice seem normal, even if it’s not.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/copyright-rules-ai-art/" >AI content falls outside of copyright protection laws <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Since you can’t claim ownership, using them commercially could have legal consequences.</p><p> Also, AI writing tools are unsustainable.<a class="link"   href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/12/google-raters-guidelines-e-e-a-t" >Google <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> prioritizes authoritative websites that publish well-researched articles—it might start cracking down on AI content soon. It already prohibits manipulating SERP rankings with AI, after all.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123736/7443" target="_top" id="2123736">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123736" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123736/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Do-AI-Chatbots-Positively-or-Negatively-Impact-the-Content-Industry"><a href="#Do-AI-Chatbots-Positively-or-Negatively-Impact-the-Content-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Do AI Chatbots Positively or Negatively Impact the Content Industry?"></a>Do AI Chatbots Positively or Negatively Impact the Content Industry?</h2><p> Despite all these points, you can’t just call AI chatbots a positive or negative influence on the content industry. AI is inherently unbiased. Instead of criticizing chatbots, blame writers for exploiting them. Harmful, plagiarized, and damaging output stem from human prejudices—machines only respond to input.</p><p> Writers should learn to use AI responsibly. Find out about platforms that can help you find typos, research topics, outline articles, and analyze SEO keywords. Automate rote work whenever possible. Free up your time for writing tasks that require critical thinking and creativity.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-screen-snip-pro-the-essential-guide-to-win-os/"><u>[New] Screen Snip Pro The Essential Guide to Win OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/efficient-windows-partition-integration-strategies/"><u>Efficient Windows Partition Integration Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/essential-guide-to-airpods-hygiene-mastering-the-art-of-deep-cleaning-and-disinfecting-for-optimal-health/"><u>Essential Guide to AirPods Hygiene: Mastering the Art of Deep Cleaning & Disinfecting for Optimal Health</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/fix-itbm-driver-not-available-error-easily/"><u>Fix ITBM Driver Not Available Error.

For starters, ChatGPT free users can only send around 16 GPT-4o messages within a three-hour period. Once you hit the message limit, ChatGPT will block access to GPT-4o.</p><p> Second, although GPT-4o is a fully multimodal AI model, it doesn’t support DALL-E image creation. While that is an unfortunate restriction, it’s also not a huge problem, as you can easily use Microsoft Copilot.</p><p> Free GPT-4o access comes with some excellent features, though. ChatGPT free users can use GPT-4o for web browsing searches and questions, data analysis, image analysis, and extensive file support. So, it brings many of the core features of the ChatGPT Plus tier to free users. It also allows free users to access custom GPTs, though these have the same limits as GPT-4o messaging (and free users cannot make custom GPTs, only interact with them).</p><h2 id="3-Perplexity-ai"><a href="#3-Perplexity-ai" class="headerlink" title="3.Perplexity.ai"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://www.perplexity.ai/" >Perplexity.ai <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/perplexity-ai-pro-search-option.jpg"                      alt="perplexity ai pro search option"                ></p><p> Perplexity.ai is a very promising AI tool with the option to use GPT-4 for free.

OpenAI’s hardware has been taking a pounding, and there are more than a few existing subscribers expressing discontent about the diminishing service.</p><p> Slower processing times, periodic downtime, blackouts, and more have seen a considerable uptick since the November 6 event. For those who have rapidly integrated ChatGPT and generative AI into workflows and elsewhere, any downtime is keenly felt.</p><p> However, despite ChatGPT subscriptions being closed, it won’t take them long to reopen.

Yep, join the club. But you may want to try it again. Apple has finally transformed the much-maligned app into a more usable and friendly program. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PKTQ5699M62?hl=en-US&gl=US" >Available in the Microsoft Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the new iCloud for Windows comes with a complete redesign, new features, and bug fixes.</p><p>Beyond the redesign, the latest version offers an easier setup process with prompts to guide you each step of the way. It now supports physical security keys for a more secure sign-in. And thankfully, you won’t get as many of those sign-in prompts as you did in the past.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/goodbye-itunes-apple-officially-releases-replacement-media-apps-for-windows/" >Goodbye, iTunes: Apple officially releases replacement media apps for Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>You’re now able to see the syncing status of your iCloud content. In addition, Apple promises improvements to photo syncing and fixes for contact and calendar syncing with Outlook. The Outlook syncing, however, supposedly requires <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose/" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> version 22H2 or later.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The latest features and improvements are designed to fix an app that for years has been clunky, confusing, and buggy. Past versions of the app have received a slew of one-star ratings in the Microsoft Store. And that’s because you’re using a Windows PC and not a Mac.</p><p>Mac owners can easily sync their online iCloud content using a convenient and simple built-in MacOS feature. But Windows users have faced challenges in this process. With no iCloud syncing tool built into Windows, your only option has been the iCloud for Windows app. And this always felt like an app that Apple threw together haphazardly just to placate Windows users.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cloud-storage/" >The best cloud storage services <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For those of you who haven’t yet tried iCloud for Windows, the app lets you sync specific items stored in iCloud online to your Windows PC. In that vein, it offers several key features.</p><p>You can access and view your synced iCloud photos in the Microsoft Photos app for <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-11-faq-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can keep your photos up to date across your PC, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/" >iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Plus, you’re able to create shared albums that other people can view.</p><p>If you enable iCloud Drive, you can see and access your online folders and files directly in File Explorer. You’re also able to share files and automatically sync any changes to your files.</p><p>The app lets you sign in to websites using credentials you’ve stored in iCloud Keychain. You can access all your passwords and create new ones in the iCloud Passwords app, which is automatically added when you install iCloud for Windows. The iCloud Passwords extension also works in the desktop versions of Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. You can even generate verification codes to sign in to websites.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-access-and-sync-icloud-notes-on-linux/" >How to access and sync iCloud notes on Linux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>And there’s more. You’re able to view your iCloud calendars and contacts directly in Microsoft Outlook. And you can sync your bookmarks from Safari with the iCloud bookmarks extension in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.</p><p>If you already have a previous version of iCloud for Windows, the new version will automatically be installed the next time you open the app. If you don’t yet have it, head to its <a class="link"   href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PKTQ5699M62?hl=en-US&gl=US" >Microsoft Store page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download and install it.</p><p>After launching the app and signing in the first time, the setup screens will ask you which content you wish to sync. You can opt to sync your iCloud photos to the Microsoft Photos app, sync iCloud Drive to File Explorer, sync your passwords in iCloud Keychain, sync your Safari bookmarks, and sync your iCloud calendars and contacts with Outlook.</p><p>After the setup is complete, you’re placed at the newly-redesigned iCloud for Windows screen. Here, you can clearly see the syncing status of each type of content and choose which ones to turn on or off. The screen also shows you how much total space you’ve used in iCloud and how much is free.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/" >The best laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Is the new iCloud for Windows a dramatic improvement over its predecessor? A few people chiming in at the Microsoft Store have complained of syncing problems and other glitches. But an equal number have given the overhaul five-star ratings. Some reports say the app overall works better in Windows 11 than in <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-your-windows-10-pc-be-saved-in-2025-yes-for-free-heres-how/" >Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, especially the photo, contacts, and calendar syncing.</p><p>In my testing, the app ran smoothly in Windows 11 with no hiccups. It did crash once in Windows 10 when I was trying to sync my iCloud photos, but otherwise, it’s been behaving. At the very least, it already seems like a decided improvement over the old version.</p><h4 id="Apple"><a href="#Apple" class="headerlink" title="Apple"></a>Apple</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-hands-on/"  title="iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you&#39;ll get">iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you’ll get <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ios-18-settings-i-changed-immediately-and-why-you-should-too/"  title="6 iOS 18 settings I changed immediately -

OpenAI’s open-source speech recognition system called “Whisper” allows you to speak to ChatGPT and get answers to your questions.</p><p> You can use this feature to generate codes, get answers, or have a quick brainstorming session with just your voice.</p><h2 id="What-You-Need-to-Speak-to-ChatGPT"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Speak-to-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Speak to ChatGPT"></a>What You Need to Speak to ChatGPT</h2><p> ChatGPT’s Whisper integration allows you to use your voice to speak with ChatGPT instead of typing.

The opening keynote, which took place on Monday, focused almost entirely on the buzzword we can’t stop talking about – <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-to-know-about-apples-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >artificial intelligence (AI) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-to-know-about-apples-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >Everything to know about Apple’s AI features coming to iPhones, Macs, and iPads <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>After trailing behind major players like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, Apple unveiled a slew of AI features spread across the company’s most popular operating systems. While AI was the event’s main focus, Apple executives also announced this year’s software upgrades for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, and Vision Pro.</p><p>If you couldn’t tune into the two-hour-long event, ZDNET has you covered. Here’s a complete breakdown of all the announcements from earlier this week.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Apple-Intelligence-AI"><a href="#Apple-Intelligence-AI" class="headerlink" title="Apple Intelligence (AI)"></a>Apple Intelligence (AI)</h2><p>Maria Diaz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><ul><li>Apple unveiled what it calls its new “personal intelligence” system under the name <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-how-it-works-with-on-device-and-cloud-based-ai/"><strong>Apple Intelligence</strong></a>. The release puts generative models at the heart of the ecosystem of Apple devices.</li><li>With Apple Intelligence, your iPhone can <strong>prioritize notifications</strong> to ensure you get notified only when it’s crucial throughout your day.</li><li>The release includes <strong>writing tools</strong> that leverage AI, including rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text features available across mail, keynotes, third-party apps, and more.</li><li>Users can now create <strong>personalized images</strong> in the photo library, including sketches, illustrations, and animations. This feature is available in Messages, Apps, Freeform, Keynote, and Pages.</li><li>Apple Intelligence can tap into tools and <strong>carry out tasks on your behalf</strong>, such as “Show me all the photos,” “Play the podcast,” or “Pull the files that my coworker shared with me last week.”</li><li>Because it’s grounded in your personal information and context, and can retrieve data from across your apps and reference the content on your screen, Apple Intelligence is positioned to be your <strong>personal assistant</strong>.</li><li>Apple emphasized the <strong>safety and privacy precautions</strong> built into Apple Intelligence, particularly for on-device intelligence processing. The company touted the security of Apple’s silicon, A17 Pro, and its M family of chips (M1, M2, M3, and M4).</li><li>For tasks that are too large for on-device processing and need to be completed in the cloud, Apple unveiled <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-apples-keeping-your-cloud-processed-ai-data-safe-and-why-it-matters/" >Private Cloud Compute <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, which protects users’ privacy by running on servers specially created using Apple Silicon. When users make requests, Apple Intelligence first tests on-device capability, but calls on Private Cloud Compute if the task requires more power. Apple reiterated that user data is never stored or sold to external parties.</li><li><strong>Siri</strong> finally got the AI makeover it deserves, first with a new look: when tapped, light wraps around the edges of your screen. Siri can now <strong>better understand users</strong>, even if they stutter, due to more advanced natural language processing (NLP). It now has <strong>conversational</strong> <strong>context</strong>, remembering what you just said and using it to complete the next task. Users can also <strong>type requests to</strong> <strong>Siri</strong>. Because it has <strong>in-depth product knowledge</strong>, Siri can answer questions about functionality on iPad, iPhone, and Mac. Siri will also have Apple Intelligence’s <strong>on-screen awareness</strong>, allowing it to act on what it sees. The voice assistant can also <strong>take actions</strong> across apps, including photo editing. With access to your <strong>personal context,</strong> Siri can understand and complete new commands, such as pulling your driver’s license information from a photo and inputting it into a form. The Siri updates are coming to iPad and Mac, too.</li><li>Apple Intelligence also powers new features in <strong>Mail</strong>, including <strong>Rewrite</strong>, which offers users different versions of what they have already drafted. <strong>Suggestions</strong> are shown in-line, and <strong>Proofread</strong> edits forgrammar, word choice, and sentence structure. You can also use <strong>Summarize</strong> to convert your text into bullet points. <strong>Smart Reply</strong> identifies relevant selections of an email and uses them to help craft a custom message. Summaries will now appear at the top of emails, making browsing an inbox easier. Apple Intelligence can even help <strong>prioritize</strong> your emails, placing what is most important at the top of your inbox.</li><li>There is an all-new focus option: <strong>reduce interruptions</strong>. When in this setting, your phone will only show you what is most important based on your personal activity and context.</li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-generated-genmoji-solve-a-problem-weve-all-had-before/" >Genmoji <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> allows users to create <strong>AI-generated emojis</strong> based on what they type. You can also create a Genmoji based on a photo of a friend. Genmojis can be included in-line in Messages and even used for Tapbacks.</li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-dall-e-apples-new-ai-image-generator-runs-on-device-and-works-like-magic/" >Image Playground <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> allows users to leverage AI on-device to create images from text prompts, which can be easily shared in iMessage and elsewhere. The feature is also available in Keynote, Pages, and Freeform, and as a stand-alone <strong>Image Playground app.</strong></li><li><strong>Image Wand in the Notes app</strong> transforms a rough sketch into a polished image and is available directly in the tool palette. For example, you can circle a rough sketch in Notes and open Image Playground to transform your doodle into a fully-fledged image.</li><li>Apple Intelligence will also upgrade the Photos app with a new <strong>clean-up tool</strong> that removes unwanted objects. <strong>Search in videos</strong> allows users to easily find specific snippets of content, and users can create <strong>Memories</strong> on-demand, using text to edit and organize photos into movies.</li><li>In the Notes app, users can <strong>record and transcribe audio</strong>, which Apple Intelligence will generate a text summary of. This experience is also available in the Notes phone app.</li><li>Apple Intelligence is free on iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and MacOS Sequoia, and will be available to try in English only this summer.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934183/19272" target="_top" id="1934183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934183/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Partnership-with-OpenAI"><a href="#Partnership-with-OpenAI" class="headerlink" title="Partnership with OpenAI"></a>Partnership with OpenAI</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><ul><li>Apple also confirmed its partnership with OpenAI by integrating <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-chatgpt-and-why-does-it-matter-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" >ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with Siri. With a user’s permission, Siri can send a request to ChatGPT for help. For example, if you ask Siri for assistance on a task it deems better for ChatGPT, Siri will suggest you use the chatbot instead and forward your request. ChatGPT’s writing capabilities can also be leveraged within certain writing tasks.</li><li>Users can access ChatGPT via this integration for free, and OpenAI will not log their data. ChatGPT Plus users can connect their subscriptions to access more advanced features, in which case OpenAI’s data usage policies apply.</li><li>The ChatGPT integration will be coming to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and MacOS Sequoia later this year.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934258/19272" target="_top" id="1934258">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934258" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934258/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="iOS-18"><a href="#iOS-18" class="headerlink" title="iOS 18"></a>iOS 18</h2><p>Adam Breeden&#x2F;ZDNET</p><ul><li>iPhone and iPad users will be able to <strong>customize their home screen</strong> further by placing apps wherever they’d like on the screen, as opposed to the usual fixed grid. <strong>App icon colors</strong> will also be customizable, allowing users to make apps any color they want or even match their home screen.

The best part is that you don’t even have to pay full price on the already affordable model – the <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Detection/dp/B0CHX7R6WJ?geniuslink=true&th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cc62b0621-bd96-4b2b-9933-355db3a0fe92%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the Starlight Aluminum Case with Starlight Sport Band colorway is $80 off at <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/ref=nav_logo?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cc62b0621-bd96-4b2b-9933-355db3a0fe92%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> right now.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Detection/dp/B0CHX7R6WJ?geniuslink=true&th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cc62b0621-bd96-4b2b-9933-355db3a0fe92%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Figuring out which smartwatch to buy can be challenging with <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/" >so many options <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market. I recently went through the process of finding the perfect smartwatch for my boyfriend, so I can give you some insight into how I decided to buy this watch, which – by the way – was a smashing success.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-amazon-prime-day-deals-live-2024-07-17/"><strong>The best Prime Day deals still live</strong></a></p><p>It boiled down to two main points: Is he an Apple user, and what did he want the watch for?</p><p>If you – or the person you’re shopping for – is an Apple user who needs a watch that fulfills basic functions like fitness tracking, heart-rate monitoring, sleep insights, and crash detection, and offers water resistance and a good battery, the Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) is a perfect fit.</p><p>Sabrina Ortiz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The Apple Watch SE will be the most seamless smartwatch addition for an Apple user since its watchOS software mirrors iOS.</p><p>In addition, despite being the most budget-friendly model, the Apple Watch SE boasts many of the same health and safety features found in the more advanced Apple Watch models. In fact, the features it <em>doesn’t</em> have – including blood oxygen tracking and temperature taking – are ones that most first-time users would likely not need anyway.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >The best Apple Watches of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>When picking a screen size, I went with the 40mm, which happens to be the one on sale for $169, because I prefer to reduce the bulk of a wearable as much as possible, and I knew he would, too. I attached a photo of the watch on his wrist for perspective.</p><p>Apple products rarely go on sale, and a 32% discount can save you quite a bit of money. Since Amazon Prime Day is already over, I’d take advantage of the deal before it’s gone.</p><h4 id="ZDNET-Recommends"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET

People not interested in these updates or on a budget may want to purchase last year’s iPhone 15 instead. It’s still a great phone.</p><p>To help you make this decision, we’ve broken down all of the most important details for the Phone 15 and iPhone 16 below.

You’d benefit from Apple Intelligence features</h3><p>Apple is rolling out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-delivers-on-hardware-upgrades-but-punts-apple-intelligence-rollout/" >multiple AI features to the iPhone 16 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Chief among them is the long-awaited Siri upgrade. The iOS assistant is much smarter than before as it is now aware of on-screen content, can better understand commands even if you stumble over your words, and can switch between text and voice inputs. This is just the tip of the iceberg, too, as Siri will fully integrate itself with <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-chatgpt-the-worlds-most-popular-ai-chatbot-explained/#link={" >ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> later in the year.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-airpods-pro-2-can-soon-double-as-over-the-counter-hearing-aids-heres-how/" >Your AIrPods Pro 2 can soon double as over-the-counter hearing aids. Here’s how <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>There is more to the AI features beyond Siri. Apple Intelligence will be able to summarize notifications and Priority Messages in the Mail app. Like Siri, the feature will be able to understand context. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >Apple Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will gain additional features later in the year like the ability to create custom emojis and perform multiple actions across apps.</p><h3 id="2-You-want-a-better-photography-experience"><a href="#2-You-want-a-better-photography-experience" class="headerlink" title="2.

On the back will be a 48MP Fusion camera serving as the main lens. It’ll have a 2x Telephoto option for up-close photography. Apple states it’ll be like having “two cameras in one.” Alongside it will be a 12MP Ultra Wide lens with an autofocus function that can enable “macro photography.” It can also take in “2.6x times more light [than before] for higher image quality.” </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/" >The 5 best iPhone 16 Pro features that enthusiasts will care about <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>On the side below the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/" >Power Button is the new Camera Control <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a tactile switch with a special sensor that can perform unique actions with a light touch. For example, pressing it quickly launches the Camera app for taking quick snapshots or recording a video. It even introduces a preview feature to help you frame the shot. And if that wasn’t enough, it’ll work with third-party apps.</p><h3 id="3-You-want-“next-level-performance”"><a href="#3-You-want-“next-level-performance”" class="headerlink" title="3. You want “next-level performance”"></a>3. You want “next-level performance”</h3><p>Powering the iPhone 16 will be Apple’s A18 chipset which the tech giant claims “delivers a huge leap in performance and power efficiency.” Its processor is 30 faster than the iPhone 15’s A16 Bionic chip and requires 30 percent less power for the same workloads. The GPU on the iPhone 16 is better too, boasting a 40 percent speed boost over the previous generation.</p><p>Gamers, in particular, will appreciate the stronger performance. Apple says players will enjoy higher graphical fidelity and consistent frame rates. The tech giant says the iPhone 16 will house a better battery. At the time of writing, it’s unknown what Apple has done to improve the batteries. However, it revealed that it updated the internal design of the iPhone 16 to allow for a larger power source and “to better dissipate heat”.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Buy the iPhone 16 View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049387/7443" target="_top" id="2049387">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049387" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049387/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-iPhone-15-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-iPhone-15-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the iPhone 15 if…"></a>You should buy the iPhone 15 if…</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134493/18498" target="_top" id="2134493">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134493" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134493/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-You-don’t-require-the-generative-AI-capabilities"><a href="#1-You-don’t-require-the-generative-AI-capabilities" class="headerlink" title="1.

You don’t require the generative AI capabilities</h3><p>All of the bells and whistles on the iPhone 16 are certainly nice, but are they must-haves? To many people, probably not. Generative AI still has its’ issues despite advancing rapidly in the past couple of years. Apple Intelligence and the new Siri may be great, but we wouldn’t be surprised to see users encounter performance problems or hallucinations.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-plus-review/" >iPhone 15 review: Why I recommend this model even to ‘Pro’ users in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Sometimes, it’s best to wait until all the bugs have been ironed out. Plus, there’s a lot of uncertainty surrounding the chipset. Early impressions indicate the A18 can handle all the AI features, but can it? Or will we see a performance drop once it launches? </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014857/22899" target="_top" id="2014857">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014857" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014857/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-You’re-on-a-budget"><a href="#2-You’re-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="2.

Apple has cut the price of the iPhone 15 by about $100 off its digital storefront to entice new adopters. </p><p>It wouldn’t be a bad pick-up, either. The camera system of the previous generation is great to this day, the A16 Bionic chip is still plenty powerful, and the Dynamic Island is a welcomed addition. You can enjoy a similar camera performance. Plus, you won’t be bogged down by nascent AI features you may or may not ever use. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/376373/633495/10014?prodsku=6417993&u=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252F-%252F6417993.p%253Fcmp%253DRMX&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >Buy the iPhone 15 $729.99 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141683/17092" target="_top" id="2141683">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2141683" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettide.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141683/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Alternatives-to-consider"><a href="#Alternatives-to-consider" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to consider"></a>Alternatives to consider</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BN96HVTW/ref=asc_df_B0BN96HVTW1725620400000?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C207e1ef8-a73e-4ff4-9b32-e9f61d3f6cc0%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >BEST iPHONE ALTERNATIVE iPhone 14 Pro Bargain hunters should check the iPhone 13 Pro.

Unlike typical iOS or MacOS feature upgrades, Apple Intelligence loads a downsized version of Apple’s Foundation Models, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-claims-its-on-device-ai-system-realm-substantially-outperforms-gpt-4/" >a home-grown large language model (LLM) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with approximately 3 billion parameters. While impressive, this is tiny compared to models like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-does-gpt-stand-for-understanding-gpt-3-5-gpt-4-and-more/" >GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which boast hundreds of billions of parameters. Even Meta’s open source Llama 3, which you can run on a desktop computer, has 8 billion parameters. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-broke-metas-llama-3-1-405b-with-one-question-which-gpt-4o-gets-right/" >I broke Meta’s Llama 3.1 405B with one question (which GPT-4o gets right) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-arrives-in-ios-18-1-developer-beta-heres-whats-new-for-iphone/" >iOS 18.1 Developer Beta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, released at the end of July, introduced the first Apple Intelligence features, but they’ve been modest so far. These include Writing Tools, which allow users to rewrite emails, texts, or letters in different tones, proofread content, and summarize or format it with tables or bullet points. Another feature provides webpage, email, or text summaries – a time-saver that cuts straight to the content. Users can also ask the Photo app to search for specific images, such as those showing someone holding a phone.</p><p>However, the integration of Apple Intelligence is not without challenges. The model, when running, may occupy between 750MB and 2GB of RAM, depending on how effective Apple’s memory compression technology is. This substantial allocation of memory to a core OS function that won’t always be used means that parts must be dynamically loaded in and out of memory as required, introducing new system constraints and potentially putting additional stress on the CPU.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-run-dozens-of-ai-models-on-your-mac-or-pc-no-third-party-cloud-needed/"><strong>How to run dozens of AI models on your Mac or PC - no third-party cloud needed</strong></a></p><p>More advanced AI features, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-generated-genmoji-solve-a-problem-weve-all-had-before/" >Genmoji <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for creating custom emoji, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-dall-e-apples-new-ai-image-generator-runs-on-device-and-works-like-magic/" >Image Playground <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for on-device image creation, and ChatGPT integration, have yet to be included in the beta.

The <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-plus-review/" >base iPhone 15 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has only 6GB of RAM, would struggle to meet the demands of Apple Intelligence as it evolves and becomes more integrated into iOS, core Apple applications, and developer applications. Older iPhones have <a class="link"   href="https://iosref.com/ram-processor" >6GB of RAM or less <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and are not eligible to run Apple Intelligence in current iOS 18.1 builds. </p><p>Due to their 8GB of onboard RAM, only the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max can run Apple Intelligence, and it is strictly a beta feature that can be enabled or disabled at user preference within Settings.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-1-update-every-iphone-model-that-will-support-apples-new-ai-features-for-now/" >iOS 18.1 update: Every iPhone model that will support Apple’s new AI features (for now) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Recent leaks have <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/iphone-16-leak-just-spilled-the-specs-and-prices-on-all-four-models" >spilled the specifications <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of the iPhone 16 lineup, providing a clearer picture of what to expect. The base iPhone 16 is expected to feature the A18 processor with 8GB of RAM, while the iPhone 16 Pro models might sport the A18 Pro with up to 12GB of RAM, although <a class="link"   href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/iphone-17-feature-12gb-ram-up-from-8gb/" >recent rumors indicate this may be rolled out for iPhone 17 instead <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This increase in memory is crucial, considering the demanding nature of Apple Intelligence features. However, whether it will fully address performance concerns remains to be seen.</p><p>Interestingly, despite these hardware upgrades, Apple appears to be keeping prices similar to those of the iPhone 15 series, with the base iPhone 16 starting at $799. The iPhone 16 Pro, however, is rumored to start at $1,099, a $100 increase from its predecessor, likely due to the additional storage and upgraded components. The Pro models are also expected to introduce Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, a new telephoto lens, and larger screens – 6.3 inches for the Pro and 6.9 inches for the Pro Max.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-will-improve-siri-in-2024-but-dont-expect-most-updates-until-2025/" >Apple Intelligence will improve Siri in 2024, but don’t expect most updates until 2025 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Despite these upgrades, the iPhone 16 may still face challenges due to design cycles that didn’t fully account for the scope of Apple Intelligence’s capabilities. As a result, users may experience suboptimal performance and a less seamless user experience, especially as more AI features roll out in subsequent updates.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151865/7443" target="_top" id="2151865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151865/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-you-shouldn’t-buy-the-iPhone-16-for-Apple-Intelligence"><a href="#Why-you-shouldn’t-buy-the-iPhone-16-for-Apple-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="Why you shouldn’t buy the iPhone 16 for Apple Intelligence"></a>Why you shouldn’t buy the iPhone 16 for Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Besides memory concerns, AI processing demands a lot of power and additional computing resources. Without significant advancements in battery and power management technology, users might have to charge their phones more often.

By 2025, we may see more advanced and dependable integration of Apple Intelligence not only in mobile devices and Macs, but also in products like the Apple Watch, HomePod, Apple TV, and a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/to-rescue-the-vision-pro-apple-must-do-these-3-things/" >consumer-oriented version of the Vision headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>To extend Apple Intelligence to these less powerful devices, as the company is doing with its “Private Cloud Compute” by running <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-is-building-a-high-security-os-to-run-its-ai-data-centers-heres-what-we-know-so-far/" >secure Darwin-based servers in their data centers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more advanced LLM processing, Apple might leverage cloud-based resources for these less-powerful systems through fully developed data center capabilities and partnerships with companies like OpenAI or Google.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/to-rescue-the-vision-pro-apple-must-do-these-3-things/" >To rescue the Vision Pro, Apple must do these 3 things <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Alternatively, Apple could consider a distributed or “mesh” AI processing system, where idle devices within a household or enterprise can assist less powerful ones with LLM queries.</p><p>Apple could achieve this by equipping MacOS, iOS, and iPadOS with Apple Intelligence and the on-device LLM as planned. Subsequent changes could enable all devices to communicate their generative AI capabilities and idle processing state. This would allow them to act as proxies for each other’s Apple Intelligence requests. </p><p>Enterprises may also employ a mobile device management solution to facilitate access to on-device LLMs with business Macs. Additionally, iPhones or Macs could be used as proxies for Apple Watch or HomePod requests for mobile users. We may also see a more powerful Apple TV with more onboard memory and processing to act as an Apple Intelligence “hub” for every Apple device in a household.</p><p>Imagine your iPhone using the unused processing power of your Mac or iPad, all equipped with on-device LLMs, to tackle complex AI tasks.

With seemingly so much power, can it design effective workouts for you, as well?</p><p> By comparing the AI chatbot’s workout plans to similar exercises and routines available now on websites and apps, it’s easy to see what the chatbot gets right as well as highlight its potential weak spots. Here’s what to know about ChatGPT and its use in the fitness realm.</p><h2 id="What-Is-ChatGPT"><a href="#What-Is-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="What Is ChatGPT?"></a>What Is ChatGPT?</h2><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/" >AI chatbot ChatGPT works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by generating natural-sounding responses to prompts that you type. Although this type of technology has existed for a while, ChatGPT in particular is notable for its (mostly) accurate and intelligent responses.</p><p> Despite a few limitations—the chatbot has limited information about the world after about 2021—it’s useful for summarizing books, writing a resume, debugging code, and much more. But does it have enough information to design a workout plan for you? Here’s how ChatGPT responded to common requests for three different types of workout plans.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1912746">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1912746">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmindmanager.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1912746%2F20231'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1912746/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Basic-Workout-Plans-From-ChatGPT"><a href="#Basic-Workout-Plans-From-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Basic Workout Plans From ChatGPT"></a>Basic Workout Plans From ChatGPT</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-workout-plan-for-beginners-prompt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT workout plan for beginners prompt"                ></p><p> For the first prompt, I asked ChatGPT to create a workout plan for beginners. The basic workout plan it generated allotted time for cardio, resistance training, warm-ups, and cool-downs.</p><p> For the most part, it looks like a solid plan that you might find on any<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-beginner-workout-apps-fitness-newbies/" >beginner-friendly workout app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , such as the J&amp;J Official 7 Minute Workout. There’s even a note at the end to increase your duration slowly over time and stay hydrated, which is excellent advice for any athlete.</p><p> In this instance, ChatGPT responded to the prompt with a standard list of exercises that would work well for many people. If you’re interested in a simple, straightforward fitness routine, then its suggestions are legitimate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-workout-plan-for-advanced-athletes-prompt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT workout plan for advanced athletes prompt"                ></p><p> Meanwhile, a second plan for more seasoned athletes follows a similar format, including plenty of examples for cardio, core, and resistance training. Each section includes many options.</p><p> For instance, you can decide to use resistance bands or weights for strength training or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and cycling for cardio work.</p><p> A note reinforcing the importance of rest and recovery helps make sure you aren’t overtraining as well. Again, it’s a dependable plan to increase your baseline fitness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chat-gpt-injury-recovery-prompt.jpg"                      alt="Chat GPT injury recovery prompt"                ></p><p> What if you are recovering from an injury? It’s safest (and always recommended) to consult your doctor for any specific questions about how you can exercise with an injury or other health concern, but I wanted to see how the bot would respond.</p><p> Wisely, this response also includes a prompt to listen to your healthcare provider, so ChatGPT covers its bases in that way. It also encourages you to stretch gently, incorporate low-impact activities where appropriate, and avoid pushing too hard right away.</p><p> As someone who has recovered from a fair share of sports injuries, this is the same kind of advice I received from physicians and physical therapists when returning to activities. Again, nothing can replace personalized advice from a healthcare provider, but the chatbot gets the broad strokes correct and advises caution.</p><h2 id="How-ChatGPT-Creates-Running-Plans"><a href="#How-ChatGPT-Creates-Running-Plans" class="headerlink" title="How ChatGPT Creates Running Plans"></a>How ChatGPT Creates Running Plans</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-running-plan-question-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT running plan question screenshot"                ></p><p> Next, I prompted the chatbot to create a running plan. It responded with several questions about my current fitness level, as well as overall training goals, to generate a more detailed response.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-10k-running-plan-prompt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT 10K running plan prompt"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132162/7443" target="_top" id="2132162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132162/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> I responded to the questions in order, and it provided a multi-week plan. The plan is actually pretty solid, even taking potential injuries into account, but it didn’t get into more granular details like pacing.</p><p> If your goal focuses on speed (such as running a 10K in less than an hour), then you may want a plan that targets a certain pace. In this example, you’d need to hold around a 9:30&#x2F;mile pace to complete the 10K in under one hour.</p><p> Even with a few attempts at follow-up questions, the chatbot did not respond with any specific pacing information. Compared to similar<a class="link"   href="https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a30911910/download-your-runners-world-training-plan/" >training plans from Runner’s World <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the ChatGPT responses are not quite as detailed; however, they do offer basic plans that can help you get ready for specific distances.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-boston-qualifier-prompt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Boston qualifier prompt"                ></p><p> However, there is some level of self-awareness with ChatGPT’s advice on this topic (if you can say such a thing about AI technology). For instance, if you ask it to create a running plan that will help you qualify for the Boston Marathon, then it directs you to find an online plan that already addresses this ambition. It’s a huge, years-long goal, even for many talented runners, and the app rightly doesn’t attempt to offer a pat response.</p><p> While ChatGPT provides adequate training plans for runners, there are many free resources for running plans online that offer much more detail. In time, however, it’s likely the chatbot will be able to provide more in-depth plans that take pacing, heart rate zones, and more information into account.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151869/7443" target="_top" id="2151869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Strength-Training-Plans-From-ChatGPT"><a href="#Strength-Training-Plans-From-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Strength Training Plans From ChatGPT"></a>Strength Training Plans From ChatGPT</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-strength-training-prompt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT strength training prompt"                ></p><p> Likewise, ChatGPT’s general strength training plan is also pretty dependable, calling for bodyweight exercises like squats and push-ups as well as dumbbell rows. It’s similar to what you might find from<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-weightlifting-apps/" >top strength-training apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> What if you have more specific questions about how to perform the exercises correctly?

It offered helpful pointers about your stance, grip, and even breathing techniques in order to make the most of this particular exercise.</p><p> If you ever need to double-check the way to perform a certain exercise, or simply try out a new series of strength workouts, then ChatGPT is a helpful resource. The simple, straightforward responses and training plans offer a lot of information for beginner and more experienced athletes looking to increase their strength.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Google-Bard-and-Bing-Chat-Analyzing-Which-Conversational-Agent-Reigns-Supreme"><a href="#Google-Bard-and-Bing-Chat-Analyzing-Which-Conversational-Agent-Reigns-Supreme" class="headerlink" title="Google Bard and Bing Chat - Analyzing Which Conversational Agent Reigns Supreme"></a>Google Bard and Bing Chat - Analyzing Which Conversational Agent Reigns Supreme</h2><p> Google Bard was released shortly after Microsoft’s Bing Chat, and both tools are hoping to grab a healthy share of the burgeoning generative AI and integrated AI search market. But what are the differences between them? And which chatbot is right for you?</p><h2 id="What-Are-the-Differences-between-Google-Bard-and-Bing-Chat"><a href="#What-Are-the-Differences-between-Google-Bard-and-Bing-Chat" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Differences between Google Bard and Bing Chat?"></a>What Are the Differences between Google Bard and Bing Chat?</h2><p> Outwardly, both tools look similar. They both offer a simple interface with a text box to allow you to “chat” with them. However, dig a little deeper, and significant differences become apparent. To test the tools for yourself, you will need a Google and Microsoft account, although you might have to join a<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-join-google-bard-ai-waitlist/" >waitlist for Google Bard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> To compare Google Bard and Bing AI Chat, we derived a simple test. We used them to conduct research for an imaginary article on atmospheric CO2 levels and climate change. This enabled us to draw comparisons on several metrics, including the quality and size of the response, the accuracy of the data, and ease of use.</p><h2 id="Bing-Chat-vs-Google-Bard-Response-Quality"><a href="#Bing-Chat-vs-Google-Bard-Response-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Bing Chat vs. Google Bard: Response Quality"></a>Bing Chat vs. Google Bard: Response Quality</h2><p> We began by asking both platforms an identical question: “How do modern-day CO2 levels compare to the last ice age?”</p><p> There were differences between how both models approached the question. First up, we will look at Google Bard’s answer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-bard-responding-to-co2-levels.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot Bard Responding to CO2 Levels"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006928/19272" target="_top" id="2006928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> As you can see, the answer seems comprehensive and details current and historic CO2 levels in parts per million (PPM). By contrast, Bing Chat took a different approach.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-bing-responding-to-co2-levels.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot Bing responding to CO2 Levels"                ></p><p> The first notable difference is the approach taken in quantifying CO2 levels. Rather than list CO2 levels in terms of ppm, Bing Chat presented the data in terms of percentages.</p><p> The length and tone of the responses also differed. The Bing Chat response was shorter and more restrained, not offering opinions on the problem or potential solutions.</p><p> Bard produced a longer answer that also discussed the problem and the need to take urgent action. This was outside the focus of the question, but it confirms just how quickly the tone and direction of any research can be swayed depending on the tool you use.</p><h2 id="Bing-Chat-vs-Google-Bard-Response-Accuracy"><a href="#Bing-Chat-vs-Google-Bard-Response-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="Bing Chat vs. Google Bard: Response Accuracy"></a>Bing Chat vs. Google Bard: Response Accuracy</h2><p> Before we look at this, it is important to note that both tools make clear that the accuracy of the information generated cannot be guaranteed. As such, we are not going to check every detail. Rather, we will look at how easy it is to fact-check the response of each tool.</p><p> Based on the answers to our original question, one major difference was apparent. Although the Bing Chat reply was less specific with the information, it did supply links to the cited sources. On the other hand, Google Bard provided no links in its response.</p><p> Furthermore, Bing Chat also allows you to scroll down to the “traditional” Bing search engine. Bard has included a<strong>Google it</strong> button, which activates a hyperlink that launches Google in a new tab. These are both useful features that allow you to check the supplied info against further sources.</p><p> This is probably good because one other interesting feature in Bard’s reply was the ability to view other drafts. Although the figures in the other drafts were similar, there was variation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-bard-co2-levels-with-other-drafts-showing.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot Bard  CO2 Levels with other drafts showing"                ></p><p> The main takeaway from this section is the importance of checking the accuracy of the information received from any chatbot.</p><h2 id="Bing-Chat-vs-Google-Bard-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#Bing-Chat-vs-Google-Bard-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="Bing Chat vs. Google Bard: Ease of Use"></a>Bing Chat vs. Google Bard: Ease of Use</h2><p> There is nothing complicated about either model. If you have used a messaging app, you can use these tools. However, we did notice some differences that are relevant here.</p><p> We liked the fact that Bing Chat allowed you to scroll down to the Bing search engine. The<strong>Google it</strong> button was similar but involved opening new tabs. It’s not a big issue, but the Bing option was just that bit easier to use.</p><p> Perhaps more telling was another issue we found when testing the tools. We found ourselves puzzled by Bard’s response to a simple request to “write some bullet points for a blog on global warming.” This should be a request that any chatbot should handle. But, as you can see, Bard seemed confused by the request.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bard-responding-to-requests-for-bullet-points.jpg"                      alt="Bard responding to requests for bullet points"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997635/19272" target="_top" id="1997635">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997635" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997635/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Whereas Bing Chat handled the request perfectly and responded with some bullet points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bing-chat-screenshot-global-warming-blog-points.jpg"                      alt="Bing Chat Screenshot Global Warming Blog Points"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037350/7443" target="_top" id="2037350">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037350" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037350/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>We did manage to get a response from Bard by rewording the prompt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-of-bard-response-to-reworded-essay-prompt.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of bard response to reworded essay prompt"                ></p><p> As both platforms are going through rapid development, the user experience will continue to improve.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531879">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531879">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531879%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531879/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Are-the-Differences-Between-the-Language-Models"><a href="#What-Are-the-Differences-Between-the-Language-Models" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Differences Between the Language Models?"></a>What Are the Differences Between the Language Models?</h2><p> The last major difference regards the “engines” that power both platforms. These Large Language Models (LLMs) are the underpinning technology. We don’t need to go into great detail, but LLMs are important when choosing a platform.</p><p> Bing Chat uses GPT-4 to generate results, whereas Google’s LaMDA powers Google Bard. As a result, the architecture of the models is different, and this can affect the answers.</p><p> GPT-4 is a generative model. It generates answers based on the text it’s been trained on. By contrast,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-google-lamda-ai/" >LaMDA works differently <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —it is a discriminative model, meaning it can distinguish between various kinds of text.</p><p> In essence, this should mean that GPT-4 is better at generating creative content, while LaMDA is better at answering questions about facts.</p><h2 id="Which-Is-Best-for-You-Bing-Chat-or-Google-Bard"><a href="#Which-Is-Best-for-You-Bing-Chat-or-Google-Bard" class="headerlink" title="Which Is Best for You: Bing Chat or Google Bard?"></a>Which Is Best for You: Bing Chat or Google Bard?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/confused-880735_1920.jpg"                      alt="confused-880735_1920"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118311/7443" target="_top" id="2118311">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118311" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118311/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> This is a case of choosing the right tool for the right job. When we compare the performance of both platforms, Bing Chat seems to edge it. However, there are some provisos to consider. The first is that the Microsoft offering is a more complete product, while Bard is still rough around the edges.</p><p> But don’t rule Bard out. We liked the more fact-driven approach that Google Bard took; the inclusion of ppm levels of CO2 was closer to the spirit of the original question than the Bing response. This is what we would expect to see, given its underlying architecture.</p><p> Another useful feature of Google Bard was its ability to return multi-draft options on a single prompt. This was lacking with Bing Chat.</p><p> Finally, the platforms that the tools run on are also a consideration. For example, Bing Chat is restricted to running on the Microsoft Edge Browser, while Google Bard will run on any supported browser.</p><p> Both tools are incredibly powerful and can generate intelligent answers to any prompt. But both have pros and cons, and the ultimate choice is likely to be decided by factors like user preferences and the desired output type.</p><p> They’re free to use, so we advise trying them both. These are impressive tools that are changing the way we use the internet.</p><h2 id="The-Era-of-the-Chatbot-Is-Upon-Us"><a href="#The-Era-of-the-Chatbot-Is-Upon-Us" class="headerlink" title="The Era of the Chatbot Is Upon Us"></a>The Era of the Chatbot Is Upon Us</h2><p> Regardless of the flaws we found and our quibbles with the chatbots, these are amazing technological feats that will play an ever-increasing part in our lives. The rapid development of technology will continue to push the boundaries of what these tools can achieve and how we use them.</p><p> As AI-powered chatbots like Google Bard and Bing Chat become more sophisticated and capable of handling complex tasks, they will become an even more integral part of our daily lives.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-becoming-a-maestro-at-zoom-broadcasting-on-youtube/"><u>[New] Becoming a Maestro at Zoom Broadcasting on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-prime-visual-screenshots-on-apple-systems-max-length-156-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Prime Visual Screenshots on Apple Systems (Max Length 156) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/all-must-knows-to-use-fake-gps-go-location-spoofer-on-motorola-edge-40-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>All Must-Knows to Use Fake GPS GO Location Spoofer On Motorola Edge 40 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-persistent-edit-delay-in-fortnite-proven-strategies-and-tips/"><u>How to Fix Persistent Edit Delay in Fortnite: Proven Strategies & Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-your-pc-by-reverting-amd-graphics-drivers-on-windows/"><u>How to Fix Your PC by Reverting AMD Graphics Drivers on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-to-install-windows-11-on-a-pc-using-a-bootable-usb-drive-step-by-step-guide-with-images/"><u>How to Install Windows 11 on a PC Using a Bootable USB Drive - Step-by-Step Guide with Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-from-frozen-or-halted-windows-updates-fixes-at-hand/"><u>How to Recover From Frozen or Halted Windows Updates - Fixes at Hand</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-realme-c67-4g-phone-password-without-factory-reset-full-guide-here-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Realme C67 4G Phone Password Without Factory Reset Full Guide Here</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/intel-me-troubleshooting-for-gurus/"><u>Intel ME Troubleshooting for Gurus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unlock-final-cut-pro-at-a-steal-explore-student-discounts/"><u>New In 2024, Unlock Final Cut Pro at a Steal Explore Student Discounts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/resolve-movie-irregularities-a-simple-self-help-article-on-fixing-unstable-videos/"><u>Resolve Movie Irregularities: A Simple Self-Help Article on Fixing Unstable Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-amazon-kindle-2019-your-go-to-choice-for-budget-reading-devices/"><u>Unveiling the Amazon Kindle (2019) - Your Go-To Choice for Budget Reading Devices</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Similarly, a remote monitoring app promoted for parental use or work purposes could be abused to become a privacy invader rather than a legitimate service. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-microsoft-recall-a-privacy-nightmare-7-reasons-you-can-stop-worrying-about-it/" >Is Microsoft Recall a ‘privacy nightmare’? 7 reasons not to worry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Whatever the form, mobile spyware may steal your information, track your location, record your conversations, and more. Our guide will run through different forms of malicious software that could end up on your iOS or Android handset, the warning signs of infection, and how to remove such pestilence from your smartphone whenever it is possible to do so. We will also discuss stalkerware and other ways threats closer to home may spy on you – and what you can do about it.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-spyware"><a href="#What-is-spyware" class="headerlink" title="What is spyware?"></a>What is spyware?</h2><p>Spyware comes in many forms, and it’s useful to know the basic differences before you tackle the problem. </p><p><strong>Nuisanceware</strong> is often bundled with legitimate apps. It interrupts your web browsing with pop-ups, changes your homepage or search engine settings, and may also gather your browsing data to sell it to advertising agencies and networks. </p><p>Although considered <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/malvertising-campaign-strikes-top-websites-worldwide/" >malvertising <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, nuisanceware is generally not dangerous or a threat to your core security. Instead, these malware packages are focused on illicit revenue generation by infecting machines and creating forced ad views or clicks.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-password-manager/"><strong>The best password managers you can buy</strong></a></p><p>There’s also standard mobile <strong>spyware</strong>. These generic forms of malware steal operating system and clipboard data and anything of potential value, such as cryptocurrency wallet data or account credentials. Spyware isn’t always targeted and may be used in general <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-phishing-how-to-protect-yourself-from-scam-emails-and-more/" >phishing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> attacks. </p><p>Spyware may land on your device through phishing, malicious email attachments, social media links, or fraudulent SMS messages.</p><p><strong>Advanced spyware</strong>, sometimes also classified as <strong>stalkerware</strong>, is a step up from basic spyware. Unethical and sometimes dangerous, this malware is sometimes found on desktop systems, but it is now more commonly implanted on phones. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-out-if-an-airtag-is-tracking-you/" >How to find out if an AirTag is tracking you <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Spyware and stalkerware may be used for the following purposes:</p><ul><li>To monitor emails, SMS, MMS messages, and other forms of communication sent and received</li><li>To intercept live calls to eavesdrop across standard telephone lines or Voice over IP (VoIP) applications</li><li>To record environmental noise</li><li>To hijack camera functions to take photos and videos</li><li>To screenshot mobile device activities and send them to a controller</li><li>To track victims via GPS</li><li>To hijack social media apps such as Facebook and WhatsApp</li><li>For keylogging, account compromise, and data theft</li></ul><p>Stalkerware is typically used to spy on someone as an individual and watch what they do, say, and where they go. Stalkerware is commonly linked to cases of <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-todays-technologies-become-weapons-in-modern-domestic-abuse/" >domestic abuse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>Finally, there’s <strong>government-grade commercial spyware</strong>. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-used-against-journalists-political-activists-worldwide-report/" >Pegasus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the most well-known variants, sold to governments as a tool for combating terrorism and for law enforcement purposes. Pegasus was ultimately found on smartphones belonging to journalists, activists, political dissidents, and lawyers. Unless you’re part of a group of specific interest to ethically challenged governments, it’s unlikely that commercial-grade spyware will impact you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111981/7443" target="_top" id="2111981">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111981" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111981/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-the-warning-signs-of-a-spyware-infection-attempt"><a href="#What-are-the-warning-signs-of-a-spyware-infection-attempt" class="headerlink" title="What are the warning signs of a spyware infection attempt?"></a>What are the warning signs of a spyware infection attempt?</h2><p>There are several signs to watch for that might indicate you are being targeted by a spyware or stalkerware operator. </p><p>Finding yourself the recipient of odd or unusual social media messages or emails might be part of a spyware infection attempt. You should delete these without clicking on any links or downloading any files. </p><p>The same is true for SMS messages, which may contain links to trick you into unwittingly downloading malware. For example, you could receive an SMS failed delivery notice or payment ‘request’ masked to appear from a well-known service.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ransomware-everything-you-need-to-know-and-how-to-reduce-your-risk/"><strong>What is ransomware? Everything you need to know and how to reduce your risk</strong></a></p><p>To catch a victim unaware, phishing messages will lure you into clicking a link or executing software that hosts a spyware or stalkerware payload. If the malware is being loaded remotely, user interaction is required, and so these messages might try to panic you – for example, by demanding payment to a tax office or bank, or by posing as a failed delivery notice. Messages could potentially use spoofed addresses from a contact you trust, too.</p><p>When it comes to stalkerware, initial infection messages may be more personal and tailored to the victim. Physical access or the victim’s accidental installation of spyware is necessary. However, installing some variants of stalkerware can take mere moments.</p><p>If your phone goes missing or has been out of your possession for a time, and reappears with different settings or changes that you do not recognize, this may be an indicator that your device has been tampered with.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130873/7443" target="_top" id="2130873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-the-typical-signs-that-spyware-is-on-my-phone"><a href="#What-are-the-typical-signs-that-spyware-is-on-my-phone" class="headerlink" title="What are the typical signs that spyware is on my phone?"></a>What are the typical signs that spyware is on my phone?</h2><p>Depending on the type of mobile malware at hand, there are signs you can watch out for that may indicate your smartphone has been compromised. </p><p>You may experience unexpected handset battery drain, overheating, and strange behavior from your handset’s operating system or apps. Settings such as GPS and location functions may turn on and off unexpectedly, or you may experience random reboots and unexplained crashes. </p><p>If you suddenly are using far more cellular data than normal, this could also indicate that information is being sent from your smartphone without your knowledge or that remote connections are active. In addition, another symptom could be that you are hearing unusual noises or distortion during phone calls, and although this could simply be down to poor reception, it may also be a sign of interception.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/" >The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>You may also have trouble turning off your device completely.</p><p>Certain forms of spyware focused on fraudulent revenue generation may be able to secure enough permissions to impact your bank balance. If you are signed up for services or premium SMS plans and you know you didn’t consent to them, this could be a sign that spyware is on your device. </p><p>Keep an eye on your credit cards for any signs of suspicious payments. </p><p>An important point to mention is that sometimes spyware or other forms of malicious software might end up on your device via an originally benign app. There have been cases of developers releasing a genuine, useful app in official repositories, such as a currency converter or weather app, and then – after a large user base has been gathered – the developers twist the app’s functions through a software update. </p><p>Previously, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/android-warning-these-malicious-apps-had-over-a-million-downloads-from-google-play/" >Google removed malicious apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the Google Play Store that had been masquerading as Bluetooth utilities. These apps had been downloaded by over a million users and while the apps didn’t appear malicious at first, within days, users were bombarded with ads and pop-ups.</p><p>Unfortunately, there’s little that the average user can do if an app is updated with data stealing and other malicious functions. However, if you recently downloaded a mobile app and now your phone is displaying odd behavior, consider removing them and running a malware scan.</p><h2 id="What-other-signs-might-I-see-on-Android-and-iOS-devices"><a href="#What-other-signs-might-I-see-on-Android-and-iOS-devices" class="headerlink" title="What other signs might I see on Android and iOS devices?"></a>What other signs might I see on Android and iOS devices?</h2><p>Surveillance software is becoming more sophisticated and can be difficult to detect. However, not all forms of spyware and stalkerware are invisible, and it is possible, in many cases, to find out if you are being monitored.</p><h3 id="Android"><a href="#Android" class="headerlink" title="Android"></a>Android</h3><p>One telltale sign on an Android device is a setting that allows apps to be downloaded and installed outside of the official Google Play Store. </p><p>If this setting is enabled, this may indicate tampering and jailbreaking without your consent. Not every form of spyware and stalkerware requires a jailbroken device, though.</p><p>This setting is found in most modern Android builds in <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Allow unknown sources</strong>. (This varies depending on the device and vendor.) You can also check <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Menu</strong> &gt; <strong>Special Access</strong> &gt; <strong>Install unknown apps</strong> to see if anything appears that you do not recognize, but there is no guarantee that spyware will show up on the app list.</p><p>Some forms of spyware will also use generic names and icons to avoid detection. For example, they may appear to be useful utility apps such as calendars, calculators, utilities, or currency converters. If a process or app comes up on the app list that you are not familiar with, a quick search online may help you find out whether it is legitimate.</p><h3 id="iOS"><a href="#iOS" class="headerlink" title="iOS"></a>iOS</h3><p>iOS devices that aren’t jailbroken are generally harder to install malware on than Android handsets unless a spyware developer is exploiting for a zero-day or unpatched vulnerability. However, the same principles apply: with the right tool, exploit, or software, your device could be compromised either with physical access or remotely. You may be more susceptible to infection if you have not updated your iPhone’s firmware to the latest version and you do not run frequent antivirus scans.</p><p>Both iOS and Android phones, however, will typically show some sign of a malware infection.</p><h2 id="How-can-I-remove-spyware-from-my-device"><a href="#How-can-I-remove-spyware-from-my-device" class="headerlink" title="How can I remove spyware from my device?"></a>How can I remove spyware from my device?</h2><p>By design, spyware and stalkerware are hard to detect and can be just as hard to remove. It is not impossible in <em>most</em> cases, but it may take some drastic steps on your part. Sometimes the last-resort option may be to abandon your device. </p><p>When spyware is removed, especially in the case of stalkerware, some attackers will receive an alert warning them that the victim’s device has been cleaned up. Should the flow of your information suddenly stop, this would be another clear sign to the attacker that the malicious software has been removed. </p><p>Do not tamper with your device if you feel your physical safety may be in danger. Instead, reach out to the police and supporting agencies.</p><p>Now, here are some removal options:</p><ul><li><strong>Run a malware scan:</strong> There are mobile antivirus solutions available that can detect and remove spyware. This is the easiest solution available, but it may not be effective in every case. Cybersecurity vendors, including <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.malwarebytes.antimalware&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >Malwarebytes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.avast.com/free-mobile-security" >Avast <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitdefender.security&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >Bitdefender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, all offer mobile spyware-scanning tools. This is the easiest option for run-of-the-mill infections.</li><li><strong>Use a dedicated spyware removal tool</strong>: You can also try using software specifically designed to detect and remove spyware. However, be careful to download tools provided only by reputable firms and through official sources, as one of the most common ways to package malware is by disguising it as antivirus software.</li><li><strong>Delete suspicious apps</strong>: Examine the list of apps installed on your handset and remove any apps you don’t recognize.</li><li><strong>Check device administration</strong>: Found within advanced security settings, you can check to see if any suspicious apps have administration permission levels. If so, you can try to remove it, although this could mean you need to restore your handset to factory settings.</li><li><strong>Reboot in Safe mode</strong>: Restarting your smartphone in Safe mode will prevent third-party software from operating. On Android handsets, you can usually do this by long-pressing the power off button and selecting Safe mode. This can allow you to safely uninstall apps – but it is not a failsafe solution regarding advanced spyware variants.</li><li><strong>Update your operating system:</strong> It may seem obvious, but when an operating system releases a new version, which often comes with security patches and upgrades, it can – if you’re lucky – cause conflict and problems with spyware. Keep this updated.</li><li><strong>If all else fails, factory reset… or junk it:</strong> Performing a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-prepare-your-phone-to-trade-in/" >factory reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and clean install on the device you believe is compromised may help eradicate some forms of spyware and stalkerware. However, make sure to back up important content first. On <strong>Android</strong> platforms, the reset option is usually found under <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General Management</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory Data Reset</strong>. On <strong>iOS</strong>, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Transfer or</strong> <strong>Reset phone</strong>.</li></ul><p>Google’s guide to factory resetting your device can be found <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/6088915?hl=en-GB" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and Apple has also <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph7a2a9399b/ios" >provided instructions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on its support website.</p><p>Unfortunately, some stalkerware services may survive factory resets. So, failing all of that, consider restoring to factory levels and then throwing your device away.</p><p>If you have found suspicious software on your handset, consider the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Change your passwords:</strong> If you suspect account compromise, change the passwords of every important account you have. Many of us have one or two central “hub” accounts, such as an email address linked to all of our other services. Remove access to any such hub services you use from a compromised device. For added security, consider changing your account passwords on a PC and forcing a logout on other devices.</li><li><strong>Creating a new email address:</strong> Known only to you, the new email becomes tethered to your main accounts. If stalkerware is involved, this should be an option you consider if it is safe. It can help you wrestle back control of your accounts in a discreet and quiet way without alerting anyone.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938745/19272" target="_top" id="1938745">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938745" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938745/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-can-I-do-about-about-advanced-commercial-spyware"><a href="#What-can-I-do-about-about-advanced-commercial-spyware" class="headerlink" title="What can I do about about advanced, commercial spyware?"></a>What can I do about about advanced, commercial spyware?</h2><p>Government-grade spyware can be more difficult to detect. However, as noted in a <a class="link"   href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/how-to-protect-from-pegasus-spyware/43453/" >guide on Pegasus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and other forms of commercial-grade malware published by Kaspersky, there are some actions you can take to mitigate the risk of being subject to such surveillance, based on current research and findings:</p><ul><li><strong>Reboots:</strong> Reboot your device daily to prevent persistence from taking hold. The majority of infections have appeared to be based on zero-day exploits with little persistence; therefore, rebooting can hamper attackers.</li><li><strong>Disable iMessage and FaceTime (iOS):</strong> As features enabled by default, iMessage and FaceTime are attractive avenues for exploitation. A number of new Safari and iMessage exploits have been developed in recent years.</li><li><strong>Use an alternative browser other than Safari or default Chrome:</strong> Some exploits do not work well on alternatives such as Firefox Focus or the Tor Browser.</li><li><strong>Use a</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"><strong>trusted, paid VPN service</strong></a> <strong>and install an app that warns when your device has been jailbroken. Some AV apps will also</strong> perform this check.</li><li><strong>GrapheneOS</strong>: It is also recommended that individuals who suspect a Pegasus infection make use of a secondary device, preferably running the Android-based <a class="link"   href="https://grapheneos.org/" >GrapheneOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, for secure communication.</li></ul><h2 id="How-do-I-keep-spyware-and-stalkerware-off-my-device-in-the-first-place"><a href="#How-do-I-keep-spyware-and-stalkerware-off-my-device-in-the-first-place" class="headerlink" title="How do I keep spyware and stalkerware off my device in the first place?"></a>How do I keep spyware and stalkerware off my device in the first place?</h2><p>Unfortunately, no mobile device is completely protected against the scourge of spyware. However, we have provided some tips below to mitigate the risk of future infections:</p><ul><li><strong>Protect your device physically</strong>: Your first line of defense is to maintain adequate physical controls. Modern smartphones allow you to set PIN codes and patterns or use biometrics, including fingerprints or retina scans, to prevent your handset from being physically tampered with.</li><li><strong>Update your operating system:</strong> When system updates are available, ensure you install them in a timely fashion. They contain security fixes and patches and are one of the most important defenses against malware.</li><li><strong>Use antivirus software:</strong> Mobile antivirus solutions can detect and remove spyware. Running frequent scans will help protect your handset.</li><li><strong>Only download apps from official sources</strong>: The majority of spyware and malware is found outside of Google Play and Apple’s App Store, so be cautious about installing apps from third-party websites.</li><li><strong>Enable app security</strong>: Enable inbuilt scanners that check any new app installs. On Android, you can find this setting in Security and privacy &gt; App security.</li><li><strong>Check permissions</strong>: You should monitor what permissions have been issued to what apps, and when. On Android, this can be found in Security and privacy &gt; Permission manager. If you haven’t used an app for a while that has extensive permissions, consider deleting it. If any apps appear to be more intrusive than they need to be, remove them.</li><li><strong>Watch out for malicious links</strong>: Mobile malware is often spread through phishing and malicious links, which are spread through platforms including social media services. These links may urge you to download apps from outside of Google Play or the App Store and may be disguised as everything from antivirus software to streaming services.</li><li><strong>Do not jailbreak your device</strong>: Jailbreaking not only voids your warranty but can also allow malicious apps and software to have a deep foothold in your operating system, which may make removal extremely difficult or impossible.</li><li><strong>Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):</strong> When account activity and logins require further consent from a mobile device, this can also help protect individual accounts. (However, spyware may intercept the codes sent during <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/better-than-the-best-password-how-to-use-2fa-to-improve-your-security/" >2FA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> protocols.)</li></ul><h2 id="What-are-Google-and-Apple-doing-to-protect-Android-and-iOS-devices"><a href="#What-are-Google-and-Apple-doing-to-protect-Android-and-iOS-devices" class="headerlink" title="What are Google and Apple doing to protect Android and iOS devices?"></a>What are Google and Apple doing to protect Android and iOS devices?</h2><p>Google and Apple are generally quick to tackle malicious apps that manage to avoid the privacy and security protections imposed in their respective official app stores. </p><p>In 2019, Google <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-cleans-out-stalker-apps-from-play-store/" >removed seven apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the Play Store that were marketed as employee and child trackers. The tech giant took a dim view of their overreaching functions – including GPS device tracking, access to SMS messages, theft of contact lists, and potentially the exposure of communication taking place in messaging applications. </p><p>Since then, Google has banned stalkerware ads, and the firm’s <a class="link"   href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/" >Threat Analysis Group <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is constantly publishing research on new commercial spyware strains and their potential targets.

Standalone parental control apps can be abused, and the permissions they require can be incredibly intrusive—not only for children but also for anyone’s privacy. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-parental-control-apps/" >The best parental control apps to keep your kids safe online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>A balance between a right to privacy and protection has to be maintained, and it’s a difficult tightrope to walk.

These platforms focus on restricting screen time, locking and unlocking devices, and features such as permissions list management, restricting web content and app downloads, and purchase approvals. </p><p>However, they are limited in scope and you may not be able to use them once a child reaches a certain age – and at this point, you should consider, anyway, whether or not you should still monitor them so closely. </p><h4 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security"></a>Security</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"  title="The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested">The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-turn-on-private-dns-mode-on-android-and-why-you-should/"  title="How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should)">How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-antivirus/"  title="The best antivirus software and apps you can buy">The best antivirus software and apps you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-router/"  title="The best VPN routers you can buy">The best VPN routers you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-and-remove-spyware-from-your-phone/"  title="How to find and remove spyware from your phone">How to find and remove spyware from your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"  title="The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested">The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-turn-on-private-dns-mode-on-android-and-why-you-should/"  title="How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should)">How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-antivirus/"  title="The best antivirus software and apps you can buy">The best antivirus software and apps you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-router/"  title="The best VPN routers you can buy">The best VPN routers you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-and-remove-spyware-from-your-phone/"  title="How to find and remove spyware from your phone">How to find and remove spyware from your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-effective-screenrecording-practices-for-professionals-for-2024/"><u>[New] Effective ScreenRecording Practices for Professionals for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-social-sensation-strategies-crafting-fbs-topmusicvideos/"><u>[New] Social Sensation Strategies -

But where do you find the time to start?</p><p> If you haven’t heard, you now live in a world where you can use artificial intelligence and chatbots like ChatGPT to set health goals. In this article, learn how to leverage ChatGPT for setting health goals and feel like you have a personal nutritionist.</p><h2 id="Understanding-Your-Health-Goals"><a href="#Understanding-Your-Health-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Your Health Goals"></a>Understanding Your Health Goals</h2><p> Think of setting health goals as programming your wellness GPS. Just like you’d set a destination for a road trip, health goals give you a clear route to better health.</p><p> Health goals are your roadmap, guiding you away from habits that are bad for you (e.g., co-binging pizza and Netflix) and towards healthier daily choices. Whether it’s regular exercise, a balanced diet, or solid sleep, these goals keep you on the right path.</p><p> And just like you wouldn’t start a road trip without a destination, don’t start your wellness journey without setting your health goals.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-provide-reliable-health-information/" >ChatGPT can provide reliable health information <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , so there are plenty of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-consider-using-chatgpt-health-advice/" >reasons to use ChatGPT for health advice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , including setting health goals.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043594/7443" target="_top" id="2043594">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043594" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043594/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Getting-Started-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#Getting-Started-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started With ChatGPT"></a>Getting Started With ChatGPT</h2><p> Learning<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-by-openai/" >how to use ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is easy. You can interact with ChatGPT in a variety of ways, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Ask questions</strong> . If you are wondering about the health benefits of a certain food or want to understand the science behind sleep cycles, simply ask.</li><li><strong>Engage in discussions</strong> . This is where ChatGPT really starts to shine. You can ask questions and, based on the response, ask follow-up questions specific to your situation. It will provide a response tailored just for you.</li></ul><p> To get the most out of ChatGPT, you will also want to know<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/write-effective-chatgpt-prompts-for-ai-answers/" >how to write effective ChatGPT prompts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Try, for example, “You are a nutritional expert and world-renowned health coach working with a new client who needs help establishing health goals” and see what kind of responses you get! You might be amazed at the conversation that follows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-2023-06-17-at-10-22-29-am.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT prompt and response"                ></p><h2 id="Brainstorming-Health-Goals"><a href="#Brainstorming-Health-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Brainstorming Health Goals"></a>Brainstorming Health Goals</h2><p> So you’ve chatted with ChatGPT and now you’re ready to set some health goals. But wait, what if you’re not quite sure what your goals should be? No problem! All you need to do is ask.</p><p> For instance, you could ask, “What are some common health goals people set?” and ChatGPT would provide you with a list of typical targets.</p><p> But ChatGPT can go a step further. If you tell it about your lifestyle, habits, and current health status, it can suggest personalized goals.</p><p> Here’s an example: You could tell ChatGPT, “I sit a lot for work and often eat fast food. What are some health goals I could set?” Based on this, ChatGPT could suggest goals like taking regular breaks to stretch, incorporating more whole foods into your meals, or setting a healthier sleep schedule.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-2023-06-17-at-10-24-19-am.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT response to a health question"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100538/7443" target="_top" id="2100538">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100538" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Remember, it’s your journey and your goals. ChatGPT is there to help you brainstorm and customize them to fit your needs. And if you’re ever in doubt about the recommendations you receive, be sure you know<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/fact-check-health-information-chatgpt-ai-sources/" >how to fact-check health information from ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Clarifying-and-Defining-Your-Health-Goals"><a href="#Clarifying-and-Defining-Your-Health-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Clarifying and Defining Your Health Goals"></a>Clarifying and Defining Your Health Goals</h2><p>Now that you’ve got some health goals in mind, let’s sharpen them.</p><p> For instance, if “losing weight” is your aim, ask ChatGPT, “How can I make my weight loss goal more specific?” The chatbot could help redefine this as “Aim to lose 10 pounds over the next three months through exercise and balanced eating.” Suddenly, you have a goal that’s easier to follow and measure.</p><p> The same goes for any goal. “I want to eat healthier” becomes “Incorporate five servings of fruits and vegetables into my daily meals.” With the help of ChatGPT, your goals transition from mountain-sized challenges to a series of small hurdles.</p><h2 id="Identifying-Health-Obstacles-and-Solutions"><a href="#Identifying-Health-Obstacles-and-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Identifying Health Obstacles and Solutions"></a>Identifying Health Obstacles and Solutions</h2><p> Every journey comes with its share of roadblocks, and your wellness journey is no different. But ChatGPT can help you anticipate potential obstacles and create strategies to overcome them.</p><p> For example, you might ask, “What are common challenges in maintaining a regular exercise routine and how can I overcome them?” In response, ChatGPT could highlight issues like lack of time, loss of motivation, or physical discomfort. And it can suggest solutions such as scheduling workouts, setting smaller, achievable targets, or trying different forms of exercise to keep things interesting.</p><p> Facing trouble with dietary changes? Ask ChatGPT, “What difficulties might I encounter when trying to eat healthier, and how can I tackle them?” It might suggest potential pitfalls like cravings, cost of healthy food, or lack of cooking skills, and offer solutions like preparing healthy snacks in advance, budgeting for groceries, or learning simple recipes with minimal ingredients.</p><h2 id="Setting-Action-Steps-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#Setting-Action-Steps-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Setting Action Steps With ChatGPT"></a>Setting Action Steps With ChatGPT</h2><p> With ChatGPT, you can break down your goals into daily doable tasks. Simply ask ChatGPT for advice on your specific goals. For a healthier diet, inquire, “What are some easy ways to replace unhealthy food with healthier food?” ChatGPT could suggest actions like eating more fresh fruit instead of processed snacks to satisfy your addiction to sugar.</p><p> For regular exercise, you could ask, “How can I exercise more regularly when I work 9-5 and have no energy left at the end of the day?” You will likely get suggestions like scheduling workout time over the lunch hour or cycling to work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-2023-06-17-at-10-26-09-am.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT exercise recommendations"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863035/11832" target="_top" id="863035">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863035" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/863035/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151855/7443" target="_top" id="2151855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Using-ChatGPT-to-Help-You-Achieve-Your-Health-Goals"><a href="#Using-ChatGPT-to-Help-You-Achieve-Your-Health-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Using ChatGPT to Help You Achieve Your Health Goals"></a>Using ChatGPT to Help You Achieve Your Health Goals</h2><p> From brainstorming and clearly defining your goals to anticipating obstacles and creating actionable steps, you now know how to leverage ChatGPT to ensure your wellness GPS is set on the right path.</p><p> As you embark on your health journey, remember that these journeys take time and patience.

Find Out Here"></a>Is Accessing ChatGPT Compatible With Virtual Private Networks? Find Out Here</h2><p> While ChatGPT is now a mainstream AI tool, it isn’t welcome everywhere. This AI chatbot has been banned in a number of countries, meaning residents cannot access it and make use of its features. But with a VPN, using ChatGPT may not be such a challenge in such scenarios.</p><p>So, can you access ChatGPT with a VPN?</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-and-VPNs"><a href="#ChatGPT-and-VPNs" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT and VPNs"></a>ChatGPT and VPNs</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/c64fedaf756cbcf9ac92722c1b2668052e1efc526bd85097cc0c097ddacbbc3a.jpg"                      alt="Chat GPT homepage on phone"                ></p><p> It’s easy to access ChatGPT with a VPN, just like you would any other website.
