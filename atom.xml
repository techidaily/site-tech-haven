We saw design changes, hardware updates, the implementation of Apple Intelligence, and more. The presentation was packed with reveals; both big and small. So to make things easy for you, we’re highlighting four of the best features for the iPhone 16 line.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epKTCSREjhI?si=Ez_hObK1FZrmEE7f" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Apple-Intelligence"><a href="#1-Apple-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="1. Apple Intelligence"></a>1. Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Screenshot by Kayla Solino&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Siri has finally received its long-awaited update, becoming “smarter” than ever before. The AI assistant has a richer understanding of language thanks to Apple Intelligence. Siri can now maintain context even when a user makes multiple requests. Plus it can continue following along even if you stumble over your words. If you have any burning questions about any Apple products, the AI has more extensive product knowledge to help you shop.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/" >The 5 best iPhone 16 Pro features that enthusiasts will care about <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The updates don’t stop there. Apple Intelligence enables so much more. They include but are not limited to, Writing Tools to help you edit text, call recordings for the Phone app, notification summaries, and Private Cloud Compute for enhancing the device’s processing power. </p><p>Apple Intelligence will not be available at launch. It’ll roll out in October as a software upgrade in the United States and in English only. It’ll be available in more countries like the United Kingdom later this December. And in 2025, it’ll expand to other languages like Spanish.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vPGg53vbOsk?si=CkSEN5HFPS7vDuAa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Camera-Upgrades"><a href="#2-Camera-Upgrades" class="headerlink" title="2. Camera Upgrades"></a>2. Camera Upgrades</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Apple showed off so many camera updates at the event that it is impossible to talk about every single one in detail, but we’re going to try. First, the main lens on the iPhone 16 will be the new 48MP Fusion Camera. It can take wide-angle shots like previous generations. Now it sports a 2x Telephoto option for taking clear pictures from far away. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/" >The 5 best iPhone 16 Pro features that enthusiasts will care about <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Below the power button is a new tactile switch called <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/" >Camera Control <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is a special sensor allowing you to control the camera with a few light touches. A light tap instantly opens the Camera app and a few more light touches can be used to adjust the composition. You can zoom in on a subject, adjust the exposure, or change the depth of view. The best part of Camera Control is it’ll soon become accessible on third-party apps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfEPmG_O6F8?si=93ZTVtH_zjFRz5eh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Eye-catching-colors"><a href="#3-Eye-catching-colors" class="headerlink" title="3. Eye-catching colors"></a>3. Eye-catching colors</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Every generation of iPhones brings with it new colors. For this release, Apple decided to go bold. The shades are some of the most vibrant we’ve seen in the series, especially that bubble-gum Pink iPhone. You also have the option to go for Ultramarine Blue or muted Teal Green. Of course, you still have the classic options of Black and White. </p><p>The Pro models go for a more striking design. Desert Titanium adorns their brushed metal, making the iPhones look like they’ve been forged from bronze. If you prefer something a little more low-key, the Pro models are available in the equally impressive Black, White, and Natural Titanium too.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NC0rdKEQ98o?si=HYgqC8CxF_WTO5if" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Design-changes-bring-other-benefits"><a href="#4-Design-changes-bring-other-benefits" class="headerlink" title="4. Design changes bring other benefits"></a>4. Design changes bring other benefits</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>There’s more to the iPhone 16’s design besides color as Apple made multiple changes. We’ve already talked about the camera array and the Camera Control switch. What you may not know is the company made its mobile device tougher. It is covered in the “latest-generation Ceramic Shield”, making the iPhone 16 15% more durable than before. The glass has also been twice as tough to withstand drops.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-be-updated-to-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/" >Every iPhone model that will be updated to Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones won’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple even updated the iPhone 16’s internal design, allowing the device to dissipate heat better. This means lower internal temperatures, which results in a healthier battery. The optimization allowed for more room, too, resulting in an even larger battery. The base model can last up to 22 hours on a single charge. The Action Button makes a return, giving users quick access to various functions, from activating the Translate tool to turning on Shazam.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/"  title="20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really">20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/"  title="Want a programming job?

One such feature that doesn’t get nearly the attention it should is called Focus. With Focus, you define what notifications are shown when a particular Focus is active. Say, for example, you create a focus called Writing, where you require an absolute minimum amount of distractions. However, there is one particular contact (say your agent or your spouse) that you do want to allow as a distraction (for obvious reasons). With Focus, you can do just that – create a focus that will only allow those notifications you specific to be able to interrupt your flow.</p><p>And we all know how important flow is. A few seconds of setback can take you minutes to recover from (especially when you’re in the zone). </p><p>So, how do you create this custom Flow? Let me show you. All you’ll need to make this work is either a MacBook Pro&#x2F;Air or an iMac running macOS Monterey or newer. With such a device at the ready, let’s get our Focus on.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BmegThMdrJE?si=rILo1FJb9DgnPljV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Create-a-custom-Focus"><a href="#Create-a-custom-Focus" class="headerlink" title="Create a custom Focus"></a>Create a custom Focus</h2><h3 id="1-Open-System-Preferences"><a href="#1-Open-System-Preferences" class="headerlink" title="1.

With Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft already having launched new products in recent months, Apple now finds itself <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apples-ai-advances-could-make-or-break-the-iphone-16/" >trailing behind <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the generative AI train.</p><p>“We will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence, where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said while discussing the first fiscal quarter of 2024. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-to-expect-from-wwdc-2024-siri-ai-upgrades-ios-18-macos-15-more/" >What to expect from WWDC 2024: Siri, AI upgrades, iOS 18, MacOS 15, more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Recent <a class="link"   href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-28/apple-eu-changes-sideloading-third-party-app-stores-are-future-of-the-iphone-lrxjzbg6" >reports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> hint that iOS 18, expected to be announced on Monday during WWDC and launch later this year, will be one of the biggest iOS updates in the company’s history, featuring RCS support and a smarter Siri. Sure, it’d be fun to see AI-powered music creation, a personalized fitness or meditation coach, and even AI-generated emojis, but here are the top four AI features I’m most excited (and hoping) to see with iOS 18.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6xXIR_Uh1A?si=TMXzklPEY50MUM05" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Generative-AI-for-a-context-aware-Siri"><a href="#1-Generative-AI-for-a-context-aware-Siri" class="headerlink" title="1. Generative AI for a context-aware Siri"></a>1. Generative AI for a context-aware Siri</h2><p>Unfortunately, Siri is arguably Apple’s biggest shortcoming when stacking its AI services against competitors. While Siri has become a go-to feature on its own, it lags behind its virtual assistant competitors in intelligence and capability. Mounting consumer frustration over Siri’s limitations and generative AI’s popularity gives Apple a final push to give the voice assistant generative AI.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ways-apple-can-leapfrog-openai-microsoft-and-google-at-wwdc-2024/" >6 ways Apple can leapfrog OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google at WWDC 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If Apple can give Siri generative AI, iPhone users could ask the voice assistant for more than “Open this app” or “Search Google for this.” Generative AI would let users ask Siri to draft messages and emails, explain a concept, and give personalized reminders tailored to their calendars, notes, or contacts. </p><p>The biggest challenge for Apple will be running large language models (LLMs) on-device, as one would expect it to do after its long-standing focus on consumer privacy. On-device processing means questions and responses won’t have to be sent to remote cloud servers, minimizing data exposure.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pGHmqD53gc8?si=ymgHIB6Aa7_MoUUf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Contextual-search-through-image-gallery"><a href="#2-Contextual-search-through-image-gallery" class="headerlink" title="2. Contextual search through image gallery"></a>2. Contextual search through image gallery</h2><p>Google Photos now uses AI to automatically tag photos and recognize what is captured in the image. This lets users search through photos <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-subtle-but-useful-ai-feature-was-my-favorite-google-io-2024-announcement/" >with natural language entries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, like searching for the word “Concert” and having the Photos app display all the photos and videos taken in a concert. With as many photos as I take daily, this is a feature I’d love to see added to iOS. </p><p>Apple already uses AI for facial recognition to create Memories and organize photos of people, places, and events. Adding more AI capabilities to the Photos app could allow iPhone users to search for photos using keywords or phrases, like “beach” or “picnic at Central Park last summer,” instead of scrolling through thousands of photos. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/10-things-id-like-to-see-in-visionos-2-0/" >10 things I’d like to see in VisionOS 2.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Other AI upgrades to photo galleries that could benefit smartphone users include finding and suggesting duplicate photos to free up storage, integrating AI voice assistants to search for photos with voice commands, recommending AI enhancements, and applying edits to photos. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/620kcQ7Dw7w?si=a5ussGs5HV7sG3hF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Personalized-text-generation"><a href="#3-Personalized-text-generation" class="headerlink" title="3.

Integrating text generation into the iPhone would make it easier for users to draft emails, generate stories, or edit resumes in Apple’s native apps, like Notes and Messages. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-rumored-ios-18-features-im-most-excited-about-and-ai-is-just-the-start/" >5 rumored iOS 18 features I’m most excited about - and AI is just the start <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>This is another instance where Apple trails behind competitors, as AI text generation is available in the <a class="link"   href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-9041660-15823334-1717160402000?sid=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Google Pixel 8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the Samsung <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24/buy/galaxy-s24-256gb-unlocked-sm-s921ulbexaa/&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >Galaxy S24 lineup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of smartphones, as well as Microsoft 365, Gmail, Google Docs, Sheets, and more. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XoC2TGp1PLY?si=iH9xs76NhWn4pP-E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-AI-powered-photo-and-video-editing"><a href="#4-AI-powered-photo-and-video-editing" class="headerlink" title="4.

AI-powered photo and video editing</h2><p>We’ve seen how powerful generative AI can be in photo editing with Adobe Photoshop’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-to-do-if-generative-fill-is-grayed-out-in-your-adobe-photoshop-ai-beta/" >Generative Fill <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-magic-eraser-on-the-google-pixel/" >Google Pixel’s Magic Eraser <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Unfortunately, this is another example of Apple’s shortcomings in AI applications. </p><p>I’d love to see Apple integrate these AI features with the iPhone’s camera to enhance its limited photo editing options and potentially expand into video editing. In addition to suggesting AI enhancements for photos, it would be great to see iOS improve auto-enhancement options, retouching capabilities, automatic framing and composition, photo restoration, sky replacement, and colorization. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-3-apple-products-you-shouldnt-buy-this-month-including-this-ipad/" >The 3 Apple products you shouldn’t buy this month (including this iPad) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I don’t anticipate Apple adding AI video generators to its devices.

I’ve been using Apple’s latest base iPhone model, the iPhone 14, for about 10 days alongside the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-pro-packs-a-lot-more-innovation-for-the-same-price-as-last-year/" >iPhone 14 Pro Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

There’s really only one noticeable change to my eye, and that’s the lack of a SIM card tray on the iPhone 14. Apple has made the decision to go all-in on <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/esim-vs-sim-whats-the-difference/" >eSIM, the digital version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of the small plastic card we’ve all moved between phones. </p><p>During the initial setup of the iPhone 14, I was asked if I wanted to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-esim-how-to-transfer-your-phone-number-to-apples-newest-iphone/" >transfer my existing phone number <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from my personal <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-im-ordering-an-iphone-13-pro-max/" >iPhone 13 Pro Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the iPhone 14. Keep in mind, before powering on the iPhone 14 and signing in with my Apple ID, there was no way for the iPhone 14 to know which phone number I had or that would be assigned to it. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-the-major-carriers-are-handling-the-iphone-14-esim/"><strong>Here’s how the major carriers are handling the iPhone 14 eSIM</strong></a></p><p>After selecting that I did want the iPhone 14 to use my phone number, Apple and my carrier did some magic behind the scenes and my number was transferred to the new iPhone in under two minutes. It was truly an easy experience. </p><p>I covered more details about making the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-esim-how-to-transfer-your-phone-number-to-apples-newest-iphone/" >switch from SIM card to iPhone 14 eSIM here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which should help you get started. </p><p>As for the colors, you can get the iPhone 14 in Midnight, Starlight, Blue, Purple, or Product RED, with storage starting at 128GB, with 256GB and 512GB options. </p><p>The side of the iPhone no longer has a SIM card slot. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNET</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uzb-0C0xUYA?si=F4MPhdVqyVgx7_8X" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-and-battery-life"><a href="#Performance-and-battery-life" class="headerlink" title="Performance and battery life"></a>Performance and battery life</h2><p>If you visit <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/?modelList=iphone13,iphone14,iphone14plus" >Apple’s comparison tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, pitting the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-13-vs-iphone-14/" >iPhone 13 against the iPhone 14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you’ll notice that the phones use the same A15 Bionic processor. This is the first time Apple has used the previous-generation processor in a new iPhone model, with the iPhone maker relying on the already solid performance the A15 Bionic brought to the iPhone 13. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hS27nZVi9Y?si=_Zqj_l4a4XkPqT2S" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/" >The 7 best smartphones From 5G to an amazing camera – there’s a phone here to meet your every need.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>To be clear, there is a slight difference between the A15 Bionic that’s used in the iPhone 14. It has a five-core GPU, as opposed to the four cores in the iPhone 13 version. Apple says that extra core brings a roughly 18% boost in GPU performance to the iPhone 14. </p><p>I haven’t noticed any significant performance improvement over the iPhone 13 Pro Max, but I never had a complaint about performance on the iPhone 13 in general. That’s to say – I don’t think performance is an issue with the iPhone 14. I had no issues when multitasking between apps, or playing Ballistic Baseball. Apple has a track record of supporting devices via software updates for several years, so I’m not worried about the company dropping support for the iPhone 14 anytime soon, despite having the same processor as the now 1-year-old iPhone 13. </p><p>Another internal difference between the two generations is a boost in memory, going from 4GB in the iPhone 13 to 6GB in the iPhone 14. That added memory will help keep apps and tabs open in memory longer and improve multitasking overall. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Battery life is supposed to be ever-so-slightly better, with the iPhone 14 gaining an extra hour of video playback. After over a week of testing, the battery life is my lone area of concern for the iPhone 14. Maybe it’s because I came from the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-iphone-13-pro-max/" >iPhone 13 Pro Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a bigger battery, but I pushed the iPhone 14’s battery charge to its limit on a daily basis. On a busy day, or even a day full of traveling for a work trip, I have no doubt I’d have to charge the battery before the end of the day to ensure that I’d have enough power to make it.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/bad-iphone-battery-after-installing-ios-16-dont-panic-do-this-instead/"><strong>Bad battery after installing iOS 16? Don’t panic, do this instead</strong></a></p><p>I’m intrigued to see what battery life is like on the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-iphone-14-models-compared-which-one-should-you-buy/" >iPhone 14 Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the 6.7-inch version of the iPhone 14. Battery life is usually better on the larger-screened iPhone models, and if that’s also the case this year, then the Plus may end up being very popular. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNET</p><h2 id="Camera-upgrades"><a href="#Camera-upgrades" class="headerlink" title="Camera upgrades"></a>Camera upgrades</h2><p>The biggest changes Apple made to the iPhone 14 all have to do with the camera. Apple calls the iPhone 14’s camera system an “advanced dual-camera system,” thanks in part to some hardware upgrades but also because of some <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-16-has-a-hidden-photoshop-like-feature-where-to-find-it-and-how-to-use-it-and-why-youre-going-to-love-it/" >iOS camera software features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that are new this year. </p><p>There’s a new 12-megapixel main camera with a larger sensor that harnesses Apple’s new Photonic Engine for better performance. Apple promises improved low-light performance from the engine, and the addition of a new Action mode for capturing video. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-pro-huge-new-camera-sensor-same-slow-lightning-cable-data-transfers/"><strong>iPhone 14 Pro: Huge new camera sensor, same slow Lightning transfers</strong></a> </p><p>When enabled, Action mode will stabilize your recorded video in a similar fashion to GoPro cameras. You’ll want to use the new mode outdoors, or at least in an area with plenty of light. I’ve done a couple of random jogs around my home and backyard and can confirm, Action mode does indeed keep the iPhone’s video smooth and stable. </p><p>I can’t wait to play around with this feature some more to see where it really excels, and where it falls short. The fact that it needs a well-lit environment is a bit of a letdown. </p><p>As for the main camera, I’ve taken a bunch of photos and the iPhone 14’s main camera is definitely an improvement over the iPhone 13. From a quick portrait mode photo that I took of my bulldog, Emoji, to the photo of a sunset you can see below, the iPhone 14’s camera does a great job of capturing and reflecting colors, lighting, and details. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The above photo hasn’t been edited other than cropping the image in order to publish it. All of the color and saturation settings have remained untouched. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jjGL9wFdlbo?si=Vb1JgZqRXNc03UGG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Safety-first"><a href="#Safety-first" class="headerlink" title="Safety first"></a>Safety first</h2><p>You can expect more features to be enabled on the iPhone 14 in future.

This year, Apple drew a deeper line in the sand to differentiate the iPhone 14 from the iPhone 14 Pro lineup. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-13-pro/" >iPhone 14 Pro line is clearly for those who want a major change <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from last year’s design.</p><p>As I said at the top, the iPhone 14 is a great phone, and for someone who is coming from an iPhone 11 or older, the iPhone 14 is a major upgrade.

The Nomad Sport Case is our pick for the best iPhone 16 case overall to help sheath your new phone.</p><p>ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner is a big fan of the Nomad brand. He ranks the Nomad Sport Case as the best phone case for the iPhone 15 Pro, praising it for its sleek design and lightweight feel. “I love how light these cases are. Combined with the noticeably lighter iPhone 15 Pro Max, it feels refreshingly light to hold,” Hiner says. Due to the similarities of the 15th and 16th generation of iPhones, the Nomad Sport Case will serve the iPhone 16 just as well.</p><p>This light case also offers enough drop protection and raised edges to keep the sensitive parts of your phone safe without a rugged or bulky feel. It provides protection with elegance, making it a perfect resting place for the sword – or new iPhone 16 – that is now in your hands. The Nomad Sport case is the perfect mix between lightweight and protective.

You can also pull out and rotate the ring for an optimal, on-the-go viewing experience.”</p><p>Reddit users agree, with one saying, “The overall production and material quality of the cases is excellent.

Many protective cases have this problem, making them hard to grasp and stick in your pocket. A Pitaka Ultra phone case will fix this problem.</p><p>The Pitaka brand boasts thin promises for their cases, and they follow through. ZDNET’s Kerry Wan finds it unique but weighs its pros and cons, “Pitaka is one of the originators of the ultra-thin Aramid Fiber case that you see so many brands remix today. With such cases, you’re trading drop protection in favor of slimness and minimalism, two aspects that should help reduce any discomfort when handling the larger iPhone 16 models.”</p><p>Aramid fibers, which is virtually the same as Kevlar, the fabric used in bulletproof vests and aircraft panels. Therefore, the case is durable, scratch-resistant, and protects from everyday wear and tear. If you are looking to find something protective, unique, and thin for your phone, give Pitaka a go. But beware, drop protection is not guaranteed. </p><p><strong>Pitaka Ultra Slim for iPhone 16</strong> <strong>features:</strong> MagSafe capabilities | Ultra-thin form factor | Camera protection | Aramid fiber material</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D78GQLKK?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cad37bf78-eb8c-49c4-99ed-c5bcf0b78358%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/11385907926&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Low price</li><li>Grippy texture</li><li>Clear and design options</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Low drop protection</li></ul><h2 id="Smartish-Gripmunk-case"><a href="#Smartish-Gripmunk-case" class="headerlink" title="Smartish Gripmunk case"></a>Smartish Gripmunk case</h2><h3 id="Best-cheap-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#Best-cheap-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="Best cheap iPhone 16 case"></a>Best cheap iPhone 16 case</h3><p>Sometimes, the price of a new iPhone leaves you with little money to buy a case. Luckily, there are great options that are less than $25 but serve just as well as the more expensive cases.

I’d especially recommend the Clearly Black variant to anyone who wants to show off their iPhone 16 color – and you definitely should – without worrying about the case yellowing,” said expert tester Kerry Wan.</p><p><strong>Smartish Gripmunk case features:</strong> 6 ft drop protection | MagSafe | Side grips | Camera, screen, and corner protection</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCG3PFFD?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cad37bf78-eb8c-49c4-99ed-c5bcf0b78358%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Super protective</li><li>45 ft drop protection</li><li>Style options</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Pricier</li></ul><h2 id="Mous-Limitless-6-0"><a href="#Mous-Limitless-6-0" class="headerlink" title="Mous Limitless 6.0"></a>Mous Limitless 6.0</h2><h3 id="Best-protective-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#Best-protective-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="Best protective iPhone 16 case"></a>Best protective iPhone 16 case</h3><p>Nothing is more disappointing than dropping and shattering your brand-new device, especially if you chose not to opt for Apple Care. If you handle your device with little grace, a protective phone case may be a great preventative option. Our pick, the Mous Limitless 6.0, protects and offers style in one product, so you don’t have to sacrifice either.</p><p>The case features reinforced corners with their AiroShock technology for ultimate drop protection, which they claim offers 45ft of drop protection. Kerry Wan, who tested out the case, says, “Mous’ Limitless 6.0 series is one of the more stylish cases I’ve tested, with plenty of cushioning for drop protection. There’s a generous cut-out for the iPhone 16’s Camera Control and the case is offered in various backplates, including Walnut, Bamboo, Leather, and Carbon Fibre. It’s my worth-the-splurge pick.”</p><p>If you find yourself doing more accidental damage to your phone than normal, it may be worth a look into the Mous Limitless 6.0.</p><p><strong>Mous Limitless 6.0 features:</strong> AiroShock 45 ft drop protection | MagSafe | 9 style options | Raised edges</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDLZGM2B?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cad37bf78-eb8c-49c4-99ed-c5bcf0b78358%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Drop protection</li><li>Raised edges</li><li>Sustainable materials</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Pricier</li><li>No camera protection</li></ul><h2 id="Incase-Icon"><a href="#Incase-Icon" class="headerlink" title="Incase Icon"></a>Incase Icon</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c1yHj02oP3w?si=mwi3FyP0p68gkBqV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-stylish-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#Best-stylish-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="Best stylish iPhone 16 case"></a>Best stylish iPhone 16 case</h3><p>Incase makes great laptop cases, and its designs for iPhone are no different. To best summarize this case, Reddit users describe the Incase Icon as “awesome” and “sexy.” </p><p>The case retails for $60 and does not feature the standard plastic or silicone build, but rather a woven design. Many people stick to the former, “but if you prefer the FineWoven feel of last year’s iPhone cases, check out the Incase Icon, which comes in a fancy Woolenex finish. The material is lined to be weather-repellant and tear-resistant, but the more impressive part is that it doesn’t add much bulk or weight to the iPhone,” says reviews editor Kerry Wan, who tested the case.</p><p>The Incase Icon has raised edges for screen protection, press-fit buttons, MagSafe capabilities, and 10 feet of drop protection. The case has two material options, plant-based corn leather (which comes in Pebbled Obsidian, Pebbled Cocoa, and Pebbled Oat Milk) and Woolenex woven blend (which comes in Graphite, Navy, Blush Pink, Cosmic Red, and Asphalt). The multitude of color options means the Incase Icon can fit any vibe. </p><p>Incase is a great place to look if you want a simple but stylish case.</p><p><strong>Incase Icon features:</strong> 10 ft of drop protection | MagSafe | Raised edges for screen protection | Color options</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1391923&u=4338022&m=90301&afftrack=techidaily&urllink=https://bellelily.pxf.io/m5azgm" >View now at Moft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Vegan leather is sustainable</li><li>Color options</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Not too much protection</li><li>Pricey for low protection</li></ul><h2 id="Moft-Snap-Case-Movas"><a href="#Moft-Snap-Case-Movas" class="headerlink" title="Moft Snap Case Movas"></a>Moft Snap Case Movas</h2><h3 id="Best-vegan-leather-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#Best-vegan-leather-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="Best vegan-leather iPhone 16 case"></a>Best vegan-leather iPhone 16 case</h3><p>Leather is always a stylish option to keep around your phone, but sustainably sourcing it can always be questionable.

The company’s Snap Phone Tripod Stand is a crowd-favorite among ZDNET editors, and its Snap Case is just as appreciable. The soft-touch finish contrasts well with the hard-brushed buttons, and there’s just enough spacing left for the Camera Control and charging port.” </p><p>Although it is not a protective case, it is a stylish alternative if you prefer leather or woven cases. </p><p><strong>Moft Snap Case Movas features:</strong> Vegan leather | MagSafe | Five color options</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/stores/NOMAD/page/6927BCAB-A05E-40FA-ADA7-1E37C46F23E5?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cad37bf78-eb8c-49c4-99ed-c5bcf0b78358%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9041660-15735858?url=https%253A%252F%252Fnomadgoods.com%252Fproducts%252Fmodern-leather-case-rustic-brown-horween-iphone-16-pro-max&sid=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp" >View now at Nomad Goods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Worn-in leather material</li><li>MagSafe capabilities</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Unsure on sustainability</li><li>Only for Pro models</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lp78eFEGwVU?si=-4orJBLvJJrggCJ2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Nomad-Modern-Leather-Case"><a href="#Nomad-Modern-Leather-Case" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Modern Leather Case"></a>Nomad Modern Leather Case</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASUEYpqSP5E?si=0KOZxrTVexTuUkRn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-leather-case-for-iPhone-16"><a href="#Best-leather-case-for-iPhone-16" class="headerlink" title="Best leather case for iPhone 16"></a>Best leather case for iPhone 16</h3><p>Leather is always a stylish and sleek choice for a phone case. However, it is not always the best at lasting or, sometimes, gripping your phone. That is why the Nomad Modern Leather case is a standout in this category. Even though leather is not the most sustainable material, Nomad asserts it sources it in sustainable ways.</p><p>ZDNET’s Hiner places the Nomad Leather case on his list of the best cases for iPhone 15 Pro. He writes, “With Apple’s leather cases, it would take weeks or months to absorb hand oils and become softer and easier to grip… With Nomad’s leather, you don’t have to do that. It’s soft and feels great in your hands as soon as you take it out of the box. If leather is still your thing, it’s a better leather case than the ones Apple used to sell.”</p><p>That being said, leather is not everybody’s thing. But, if you are in the market for a leather case with a MagSafe back, possibly sustainably sourced material, a camera protection, the Nomad Modern Leather case may be your winner.</p><p><strong>Nomad Modern Leather case features:</strong> 8 feet drop protection | Sustainably sourced leather | MagSafe and magnetic back</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0Ww1YIIUe4?si=cQ-Gkh9UCJABuPZU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-the-best-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#What-is-the-best-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="What is the best iPhone 16 case?"></a>What is the best iPhone 16 case?</h2><p>Our pick for the best iPhone 16 case is the Nomad Sport case for its sleek design and solid protection.

The most relevant aspects are:</p><ul><li><strong>Drop</strong> <strong>Protection:</strong> The hard truth is that all humans are accident-prone. If you are anything like me, dropping your phone is more than a daily occurrence. When picking a phone case, it is wise to consider how often you drop your phone.</li><li><strong>Style:</strong> iPhone cases go beyond just protecting the device. Like most people, you may want a phone case that matches your personal style and is pleasing to the eye.</li><li><strong>Cost:</strong> iPhones are expensive, and spending a lot on a phone case just adds to the bill. Therefore, we consider price an important factor in our selections.</li><li><strong>Special Features:</strong> Many cases have added features like MagSafe capabilities and a kickstand. We include these products to appease those who may prefer wireless charging or other necessary features.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qmQjRcnaq9g?si=jadcGtXemUAlKOTa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-iPhone-16-cases"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-iPhone-16-cases" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these iPhone 16 cases?"></a>How did we choose these iPhone 16 cases?</h2><p>To choose these iPhone 16 cases, we performed extensive research over every corner of the internet, like Reddit forums and customer reviews, to find the best picks at the time of this writing.

Video scroll bar and playback options"></a>1. Video scroll bar and playback options</h2><p>Allison Jewell&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Recently, I was lucky enough to cover Jack Harlow’s Gazebo Fest in Louisville, Ky. When I began editing content during the festival, I ran into many issues trying to filter through content to find a usable take. At one point, I had five versions of virtually the same video of Jack Harlow.</p><p>Many will agree that one of the most annoying processes when editing a video is having to hunt through different takes individually to find the best one. To add more burden, the scroll bar at the bottom was laggy and unreliable, and I could not get accurate enough in-and-out points. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-top-2-productivity-hacks-for-video-editing-that-save-me-time-and-wrist-pain/"><strong>My top 2 productivity hacks for video editing that save me time - and wrist pain</strong></a></p><p>Thankfully, the new Photos app on iOS 18 features a more accurate scroll bar to fast-forward through takes. If I had this feature at the time, I would have been able to select content much more easily.</p><p>When you do find the perfect take, the editing menu now allows an option to slow down high frame rate videos to get on-the-dot cutting. </p><p>When viewing videos, the scroll bar automatically pops up. To access the playback options, select edit and then the clock icon at the top right corner. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/97ydpSmzTJw?si=tFcelmtQX4u-b3u5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Customizable-layout-with-‘Recent-Days’"><a href="#2-Customizable-layout-with-‘Recent-Days’" class="headerlink" title="2. Customizable layout with ‘Recent Days’"></a>2. Customizable layout with ‘Recent Days’</h2><p>Allison Jewell&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Before this update, the Photos app was full of tabs. As someone who needs everything in one place, I found it messy and unorganized. Finding specific albums or putting things in easily findable places was hard.</p><p>While many would argue that the new Photos app is even more convoluted, I’d say it helps that it’s also extremely customizable. All the content rests on one screen; one scroll motion down accesses your entire camera roll, while one scroll motion up houses all of your albums, collections, people, and more. You can change this in app, by scrolling to the bottom and selecting, “Customize and Reorder.”</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-the-photos-app-on-your-iphone-with-ios-18/"><strong>How to use the Photos app on your iPhone with iOS 18</strong></a></p><p>“Recent days” is a new addition that will help me keep track of daily content. It rests near your albums and keeps all of the photos you took during the day, minus the screenshots (which we all have a plethora of).</p><p>For example, during the Apple launch, my phone was essentially exploding with content, screenshots and all. With this new feature, I can click on that date and weed through all of the hands-on content I received without the interruption of screenshots.</p><p>With customization, you can keep this collection at the top of your feed, or any other categories that would help you stay the most organized. Now I can pull content from a certain day without having to scroll all the way back, and hopefully it does the same for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6X24fPKs6AE?si=YtQy-8zy7GifgfA7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Filter-button"><a href="#3-Filter-button" class="headerlink" title="3.

The bottom left corner now has a filter button, where you can filter through recently added and date captured. And even better, you can filter with aspect ratio grids, filter out screenshots, shared with you, eliminating the annoying things. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-is-officially-available-for-iphone-heres-how-to-download-it-and-which-models-support-it/" >iOS 18 is officially available for iPhone. Here’s how to download it (and which models support it) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>To narrow content more, you can also filter to favorites, previously edited content, photos, and videos. Thanks to this update, I’ll be able to find what I’m looking for way faster.</p><p>And just with one slide up, it resets the filters. If you add the ability to organize your photos app to your liking, your photos app becomes so much more efficient.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315"

It has a variety of switch types, including tactile for silent typing, clicky for a pleasant action, and linear for a less jarring experience.”</p><p>The keys light up as you begin, thanks to intuitive backlighting, and the intensity of it can now be adjusted via companion software.

Be sure to confirm that your chosen keyboard is compatible with the type of computer you plan to use.</li><li><strong>Size:</strong> There are different types of keyboards that you can buy. Compact keyboards are often at a 60%, 68%, or 75% size, while tenkeyless keyboards come in an 80% package. There are also full-size and ergonomic keyboards, like the ones seen here.</li><li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> There are both wired and wireless keyboards available, depending on your preference.</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> The cost of keyboards can vary significantly, depending on the model and brand that you choose. For example, the Razer and Corsair models will cost you significantly more than the Apple keyboard.</li></ul><h2 id="What-size-keyboard-should-you-buy"><a href="#What-size-keyboard-should-you-buy" class="headerlink" title="What size keyboard should you buy?"></a>What size keyboard should you buy?</h2><p>There are a few different types of keyboard sizes from which to choose. </p><ul><li><strong>Full-size:</strong> This type includes a total of 104 keys and includes a numpad (or number pad). It is ideal for those who frequently work with numbers.</li><li><strong>Compact form factor:</strong> Also known as a tenkeyless keyboard, this keyboard does not include a numpad but does still offer the arrow and function keys traditionally associated with it. It is an ideal fit for those who want a more compressed feel and do not often use numbers in their daily typing.</li></ul><p>“As for the keyboard size, it depends on what you like and how you’ll use it,” advises Rosenfeld. “Some people want a compact keyboard that’s easy to carry around, while others might need a full-size keyboard with a built-in number pad for ease of use.”</p><p>Buzzetta agrees, saying it’s up to user preference, “You want to take into consideration the size of your hands, the size of your desk space, and what you’re comfortable with. It’s like a car,” he explains, “You really gotta test drive it to get the complete feel.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o-sRtqHdEYY?si=NMTMQVxJsUaoguqh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-I-buy-a-wired-or-wireless-keyboard"><a href="#Should-I-buy-a-wired-or-wireless-keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Should I buy a wired or wireless keyboard?"></a>Should I buy a wired or wireless keyboard?</h2><p>Rosenfeld offers his advice, saying, “Wireless keyboards give you more freedom and help keep your desk clutter-free. But some folks might like the stability and reliability of a wired connection better.”</p><p>Buzzetta adds, “Wired keyboards are slightly more responsive and are the best when it comes to input lag. They’re also good if you want to avoid batteries,” he explains. “Wireless is preferable if you want to get rid of wires or want freedom of mobility. Another consideration is cost, [as] wireless tend to run higher than wired.”</p><p>When picking between a wired or wireless keyboard, it’s really up to you, says Rosenfeld. </p><h2 id="How-much-do-the-best-keyboards-cost"><a href="#How-much-do-the-best-keyboards-cost" class="headerlink" title="How much do the best keyboards cost?"></a>How much do the best keyboards cost?</h2><p>The cost of keyboards can really run the gamut based on factors like manufacturer, size, type, and features.

After an extended hiatus in product releases, Beats dropped news of the upcoming Solo Buds today, alongside its new headphones, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-beats-new-solo-4-headphones-and-these-3-features-stand-out-the-most/" >Beats Solo 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which ZDNET’s Jada Jones recently had the chance to review.   </p><p>The ultralight earbuds come in four colors: Matte Black, Storm Gray, Arctic Purple, and Transparent Red, the last of which screams Beats’ iconic style. In addition, they’re going for $79.99, putting them at a very competitive entry-level price point.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-cheap-earbuds/"><strong>The best budget earbuds under $100: Expert tested</strong></a></p><p>So what do you get for a pair of <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-cheap-earbuds/" >earbuds that cost less than $100 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? The 217-gram Solo Buds claim to offer big sound in a tiny package, with dual-layer transducers in each earbud, one-touch Bluetooth pairing with both iOS and Android-powered smartphones, and customizable press-and-hold functions on the earbuds themselves.</p><p>Note, however, that the Solo Buds do not feature active noise cancellation technology, although Beats claims the earbuds’ acoustic design facilitates noise reduction on their own.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>In addition, the case – which is 100% fiber-based from recycled materials – does not actually charge the earbuds; you’ll need to plug in the USB-C charger to a power source. However, with a reported 18 hours of battery life, charging sessions should be manageable. The fast charging feature reportedly juices up the earbuds with five hours of playback from a 10-minute charge. </p><p>At less than $100, the Beats Solo Buds will join an increasingly competitive price point with other earbuds that are considered “budget” but include features seen in more expensive devices, such as the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/youre-overpaying-for-noise-canceling-earbuds-and-this-60-pair-proves-it/" >JLabs JBuds ANC 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which <em>do</em> feature active noise cancellation, and run $60. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/beats-studio-pro-review/"><strong>Beats Studio Pro: So close to being my dream headphones</strong></a></p><p>If you want to get your hands on the new Solo Buds, you’ll have to wait a bit, as they won’t be shipping until after the Solo 4 headphones do, in June 2024. Apple owns the Beats line of headphones, so their release early this summer was likely planned to drop well before their flagship line of earbuds. With <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-new-airpods-models-expected-this-fall-heres-everything-we-know-so-far/" >two new models of AirPods expected to be unveiled this fall <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the Beats Solo Buds’ summertime release should give them some time in the sun. </p><h4 id="Featured-reviews"><a

But how does it manage to keep your conversations anonymous?</p><p> As noted in<a class="link"   href="https://duckduckgo.com/aichat/privacy-terms?ref=spreadprivacy.com" >DuckDuckGo’s AI Chat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> privacy and terms of use page, the company does not store personally identifiable information. By removing metadata containing personal information like your IP address before sending your prompts to one of the third-party AI models it supports, DuckDuckGo ensures that your chats remain anonymous.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/duckduckgo-ai-privacy-measures.jpeg"                      alt="duckduckgo-ai-privacy-measures"                ></p><p> In addition to anonymizing your chats, the company states that it has agreements with model providers that prevent them from using your conversations to develop or train their models and delete your chat history within 30 days. This allows you to engage with AI chatbots without worrying about being identified, making it ideal for sensitive conversations or discussing personal information.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_aNKnMTPjo?si=Og_mEt7NP3Fbsg2n" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Use-DuckDuckGo’s-AI-Chat"><a href="#How-to-Use-DuckDuckGo’s-AI-Chat" class="headerlink" title="How to Use DuckDuckGo’s AI Chat"></a>How to Use DuckDuckGo’s AI Chat</h2><p> Launch a browser of your choice and visit the<a class="link"   href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=DuckDuckGo&ia=chat" >DuckDuckGo AI Chat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website. Click<strong><strong>Get Started,</strong> select your preferred AI model from the list, and click</strong><strong>Next</strong>. Read the<strong><strong>Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</strong> and click the</strong><strong>I Agree</strong> button to proceed. You can enter your query or use one of the suggested prompts to start your anonymous conversation with the AI model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/duckduck-ai-chat.jpeg"                      alt="DuckDuckGo&#39;s AI welcome dashboard"                ></p><p> You can pick a different chat model at any time by clicking the name of the current model on the left of the screen and selecting another model from the list. Click**<strong>Start New Chat</strong> to begin a conversation with the selected model. The DuckDuckGo AI Chat has a familiar interface, so if you have used other chatbots before, you will find it easy to use. Like other AI chatbots, you can ask questions, summarize text, compose emails, and more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KXVWj6Ar1M?si=Cd_jktmoN3e9OzH3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Are-DuckDuckGo’s-AI-Chat-Limitations"><a href="#What-Are-DuckDuckGo’s-AI-Chat-Limitations" class="headerlink" title="What Are DuckDuckGo’s AI Chat Limitations?"></a>What Are DuckDuckGo’s AI Chat Limitations?</h2><p> It’s fair to say that DuckDuckGo’s AI Chat privacy-focused approach may be a double-edged sword. While it provides a sense of security and anonymity, generative AI chatbots need a vast amount of data to predict human-like responses. In addition, AI chatbots are not static; they need continuous learning and improvement through user interactions.</p><p> The daily usage limits may also be a limitation for those who rely heavily on AI chatbots for various tasks. While other popular options share similar usage limitations, you can pay for a premium subscription to increase your limits. However, at the time of writing, DuckDuckGo has not yet implemented this option, and the daily limits may be too restrictive if you are a heavy user.</p><p> Integrating AI chatbots into search engines has created a more personalized and convenient search experience. You can use some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/the-best-ai-search-engines/" >best AI search engines to browse the web <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and access real-time information. Unfortunately, DuckDuckGo’s AI Chat does not have access to the internet, which means it cannot provide up-to-date information or answer questions that require external sources. In this case, you can rely on DuckDuckGo’s traditional search engine by clicking the<strong>Search</strong> icon on the top left side of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/duckduckgo-ai-internet-access-1.jpeg"                      alt="duckduckgo-ai-internet-access-1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2MlLvGxMwI?si=q_blGjXyJrGtzT8d" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> One common limitation with large language models is that they sometimes generate plausible but inaccurate responses, also<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-hallucination-and-how-do-you-spot-it/" >known as AI hallucination <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . While the generative AI integrations from Anthropic, Mistral, and Meta are relatively up-to-date and recent developments, ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo is a little older and is known to suffer issues.</p><p> Furthermore, DDG’s AI Chat lacks some useful features the main tools for each option include, particularly image creation. For example, Meta’s Llama can create images in Meta’s AI but not in DuckDuckGo AI Chat.</p><p> Despite DuckDuckGo’s AI Chat limitations, the ability to interact with various AI chatbots anonymously is a significant advantage for privacy-conscious users. This helps protect your identity while providing an extra layer of security. Moreover, the company may improve its AI capabilities in the future by implementing more advanced language models, thereby addressing some of its limitations.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-funnygenius-create-and-share-memes-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] FunnyGenius Create and Share Memes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-mobile-photography-with-androids-lightroom/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Mobile Photography with Android’s Lightroom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-perfectly-pinned-prompts-top-android-and-iphones-instagram-covers-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Perfectly Pinned Prompts Top Android & iPhones' Instagram Covers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/9-ways-to-fix-mails-notifications-not-working-on-windows/"><u>9 Ways to Fix Mail's Notifications Not Working on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/implementing-incremental-noise-reduction-using-audacity/"><u>Implementing Incremental Noise Reduction Using Audacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/maximizing-ai-coding-assistance-comparing-the-capabilities-of-base-copilot-versus-the-enhanced-copilot-pro/"><u>Maximizing AI Coding Assistance: Comparing the Capabilities of Base Copilot Versus the Enhanced Copilot Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/navigating-around-chatgpts-input-size-constraint-for-extended-dialogues/"><u>Navigating Around ChatGPT's Input Size Constraint for Extended Dialogues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/navigating-the-future-of-tech-in-business-harnessing-powerful-insights-from-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis/"><u>Navigating the Future of Tech in Business: Harnessing Powerful Insights From ChatGPT and Whisper APIs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/navigating-the-maze-of-auditory-reflections-three-straightforward-solutions-for-2024/"><u>Navigating the Maze of Auditory Reflections Three Straightforward Solutions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/overcoming-the-chatgpt-is-busy-hurdle-on-windows-platform/"><u>Overcoming the 'ChatGPT Is Busy' Hurdle on Windows Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/plan-like-a-pro-on-a-budget-top-eb-free-ai-itinerary-generators-and-chatgpt-applications-for-travel-buffs/"><u>Plan Like a Pro on a Budget: Top Eb-Free AI Itinerary Generators & ChatGPT Applications for Travel Buffs</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Rather, Apple is now moving further into AI language models. </p><p>Last Thursday, Apple released <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/apple/DCLM-7B" >DCLM-Baseline-7B <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a 7 billion parameter language model, on Hugging Face. The model is part of the DataComp for Language Models (DCLM) benchmark, an initiative to improve the quality of training datasets for language models.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-try-gpt-4o-mini-3-ways-to-access-the-smarter-cheaper-ai-model-and-2-are-free/" >Want to try GPT-4o mini? 3 ways to access the smarter, cheaper AI model - and 2 are free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>At 7 billion parameters, this model is comparable to popular models such as Llama 2, Gemma, and more. When tested on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark against popular models around the same size, DCLM-Baseline-7B performed competitively, even outperforming Mistral 7B, as seen below. </p><p>Apple&#x2F;Hugging Face</p><p>Despite its impressive performance, one of the DCLM-Baseline-7B’s biggest standouts is that the model is truly open-sourced, with “open data, open weight models, open training code,” as highlighted by Vaishaal Shankar, a research scientist at Apple. </p><blockquote><p>We have released our DCLM models on huggingface! To our knowledge these are by far the best performing truly open-source models (open data, open weight models, open training code) 1&#x2F;5</p><p>— Vaishaal Shankar (@Vaishaal) <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/Vaishaal/status/1813956553042711006?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" >July 18, 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></blockquote><p>Many are commending Apple for this approach as it allows other researchers and developers to build on the models and further grow advancements in the space. The model was trained on the <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlfoundations/dclm-baseline-1.0" >DCLM-BASELINE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> data, combined with <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/starcoderdata" >StarCoder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="http://proofpile2/" >ProofPile2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>data, to reach proficiency in other tasks such as coding and math.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-can-be-updated-to-apples-new-ios-18-public-beta-and-which-ones-cant/" >Every iPhone model that can be updated to Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones can’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In addition to releasing DCLM-Baseline-7B, model weights, training code, and dataset, Apple also included a powerful 1.4 billion parameter version in the package. </p><p>This isn’t Apple’s first go-around with AI models, having released others such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-model-can-understand-your-home-screen-and-supercharge-siri/" >Ferret-UI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a multimodal large language model (MLLM), and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-claims-its-on-device-ai-system-realm-substantially-outperforms-gpt-4/" >Reference Resolution As Language Modeling (ReALM) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a conversational AI system.

Here are several ways in which OpenAI’s platform can make your profile more impressive and boost your candidacy for career opportunities.</p><h2 id="1-Write-a-Compelling-Bio"><a href="#1-Write-a-Compelling-Bio" class="headerlink" title="1. Write a Compelling Bio"></a>1. Write a Compelling Bio</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/chatgpt-writing-bio-for-linkedin.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Writing Bio for LinkedIn"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNhKhWc0wLc?si=1XLYV0sXV52Xc0lu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> With 2,600 available characters, the<strong>About</strong> section of your LinkedIn profile is a great space to elaborate on your background, skills, passions, and future goals. View your LinkedIn bio as a concise summary of your professional background, skills, and aspirations.</p><p> Give ChatGPT a list of all your winning qualities, or copy-paste your CV into it. Ask the chatbot to compose a professional bio using the information. Make sure you specify its maximum length.</p><p> Proofread what the AI produces, and add missing details that would make a good impression. You can have ChatGPT edit or completely rewrite the new draft to your specifications.</p><p> When done, paste the bio into your LinkedIn<strong>About</strong> field. The more compelling it is, the higher your chances of getting an interview for that cool job you found on LinkedIn.</p><h2 id="2-Write-Job-Descriptions"><a href="#2-Write-Job-Descriptions" class="headerlink" title="2.

It gives recruiters something more interesting to read that reflects your character better.</p><p> Feed ChatGPT information about the job in question, and request a one-paragraph description of no more than 2,000 characters. You may need to edit the results or generate a new description in a different style or tone to satisfy your needs.</p><p> On your LinkedIn profile, what you should end up with under each job title are a few concise and easy-to-read lines. They should highlight what the position involved, why you enjoyed it, and how it contributed to your current skill set.</p><h2 id="3-Write-Personalized-Messages"><a href="#3-Write-Personalized-Messages" class="headerlink" title="3. Write Personalized Messages"></a>3. Write Personalized Messages</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/writing-a-professional-message-on-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="Writing a Professional Message on ChatGPT"                ></p><p> Landing a job on LinkedIn involves exchanging a lot of messages. ChatGPT can write them for you. You’d then have personalized message templates for greeting recruiters, requesting job details, arranging interviews, and more.</p><p> In each case, specify what the message is for, how the AI should express it, and what you want it to contain. For example, if you know your addressee’s name, include it. If you’re detailing your availability and have times and dates to share, ask ChatGPT to neatly list them.</p><p> As always, check the chatbot’s results for errors or clunky phrasing. Most importantly, personalize the message templates you use in different interactions, making sure they fit naturally and benefit you as a job candidate.</p><h2 id="4-Write-Cover-Letters"><a href="#4-Write-Cover-Letters" class="headerlink" title="4. Write Cover Letters"></a>4. Write Cover Letters</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cover-letter-template-made-with-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="Cover Letter Template Made With ChatGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5pwd2mwaQQ?si=qyZHgdTlbQbc32Mp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If ChatGPT can write smooth, eloquent messages, you can rest assured that it can produce highly effective cover letters as well. You could paste the LinkedIn job ad into the prompt or manually type in its requirements and how you satisfy them. Specify that you need a professional cover letter.</p><p> The chatbot will take all that data and construct a formal response to the position’s specifications, sometimes with fields for you to fill in your name and contact details, for example.</p><p> Keep in mind that the information you provide the AI will determine the points it’ll try to make to support your job application. So, structure your prompt carefully for the best outcome. And don’t forget to customize ChatGPT’s letter and make it your own.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epKTCSREjhI?si=Ez_hObK1FZrmEE7f" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Build-a-Resume"><a href="#5-Build-a-Resume" class="headerlink" title="5.

You can paste everything into a single document.</p><p> Something else ChatGPT can help you with when job hunting on LinkedIn is understanding what you should include in your resume or cover letter when applying for any job. The AI will break down what you need clearly and concisely. You just need to follow its instructions where applicable.</p><h2 id="6-Prepare-Answers-for-Interview-Questions"><a href="#6-Prepare-Answers-for-Interview-Questions" class="headerlink" title="6. Prepare Answers for Interview Questions"></a>6. Prepare Answers for Interview Questions</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/chatgpt-answering-job-interview-question.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Answering Job Interview Question"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JNxZ4Z6BVCg?si=522oz1OPSQDhNYWT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> With<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/use-linkedin-interview-prep/" >LinkedIn’s interview prep features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it’s easy to learn about different job roles, their expectations, and how best to prepare for them, starting with the interview process. Even better, ChatGPT can produce great answers to potential interview questions.</p><p> Just paste a question into the prompt and ask the chatbot to suggest responses. Not only does it come up with good options, but it also explains the reasoning behind them. You can memorize them verbatim or practice tailoring them to different interview situations.</p><p> Either way, you’ll be better prepared to face interviewers and outshine your competition for the LinkedIn job you want.</p><h2 id="7-Plan-and-Edit-Posts"><a href="#7-Plan-and-Edit-Posts" class="headerlink" title="7. Plan and Edit Posts"></a>7. Plan and Edit Posts</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/chatgpt-suggests-structure-for-linkedin-post.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Suggests Structure for LinkedIn Post"                ></p><p> There are<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-content-writers-cant-rely-ai-chatbots/" >limits to writing content with AI chatbots <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , such as monotonous language patterns, no fact-checking, and a risk of copyright infringement. So, only use ChatGPT to tweak articles or social media posts, not completely write them.</p><p> On that note, an active LinkedIn presence can attract employers as effectively as a polished CV. Think about your area of expertise and what kind of content you could share. Showcasing your knowledge and principles is very important.</p><p> ChatGPT can brainstorm with you on ideas and the best structure for each article, image, or video. It can also edit and improve any text you provide, and even suggest titles, mottos, and keywords. It streamlines your creative process.</p><h2 id="8-Check-the-Accuracy-of-Any-Text"><a href="#8-Check-the-Accuracy-of-Any-Text" class="headerlink" title="8. Check the Accuracy of Any Text"></a>8.

For even better results, upgrade to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-chatgpt-plus/" >ChatGPT Plus and its features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , such as access to Bing and advanced data analytics for greater accuracy and efficiency.</p><p> Either version can fix your spelling and grammar. But it helps if you specify the language or format you’re interested in. UK or US English? Chicago or AMA Manual of Style? Based on your instructions, the AI will spruce up your text.</p><p> When it comes to fact-checking, you’re better off relying on OpenAI’s premium package, as the free version’s database only consists of sources up to 2021. It lacks the knowledge to correct anything involving concepts or events that occurred after that year.</p><h2 id="9-Check-Your-Suitability-for-a-Role"><a href="#9-Check-Your-Suitability-for-a-Role" class="headerlink" title="9.

Even if an employer offers training, they’ll prefer candidates who already cover most of their requirements.</p><p> For an objective assessment of your compatibility with certain jobs, start by giving ChatGPT a clear outline of your professional capabilities. If you’ve been creating resumes and cover letters on the platform, the AI will have the necessary data.</p><p> Copy a job ad’s description from LinkedIn and paste it into ChatGPT. Ask the AI to compare it to your skillset, calculate your suitability, and suggest ways to improve your chances of getting the position or others like it.</p><p> Don’t make career decisions solely based on ChatGPT’s advice; it’s a handy tool for working out your strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities to focus on.</p><h2 id="10-Keep-Track-of-Information"><a href="#10-Keep-Track-of-Information" class="headerlink" title="10.

Besides tasks like planning, writing, and editing content, it can function as a guide, coach, and tracker.</p><p> When it comes to job hunting, whether on LinkedIn or elsewhere, you can use the platform to remember and analyze different information. Which roles or companies have you applied to? What feedback did you receive, if any? What skills are you often lacking?</p><p> ChatGPT can not only keep a record of your activities, successes, and misses, but it can also detect patterns for you. For example, after logging several applications and their outcomes in detail, ask the AI to find what roles best suit you and what areas you could improve on.</p><p> You’ll get a thorough breakdown of your ideal career path and even development goals that can strengthen your candidacy.</p><h2 id="LinkedIn-Job-Hunting-Made-Easier-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#LinkedIn-Job-Hunting-Made-Easier-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="LinkedIn Job Hunting Made Easier With ChatGPT"></a>LinkedIn Job Hunting Made Easier With ChatGPT</h2><p> There’s a lot to finding, applying, and landing jobs on LinkedIn, but OpenAI’s super-intelligent platform can simplify the process.</p><p> With ChatGPT’s help, you can enhance your profile and presence on LinkedIn, streamline professional communications, impress recruiters with excellent resumes and cover letters, and manage your applications far more efficiently.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-essential-imovie-techniques-to-upgrade-your-youtube-content/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Essential iMovie Techniques to Upgrade Your YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-speech-to-text-technology-absolutely-gratuitous/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Speech-to-Text Technology, Absolutely Gratuitous</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-actor-rights-free-movie-downloads-license/"><u>[New] Actor Rights Free Movie Downloads License</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-tailoring-blends-for-stunning-composite-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Tailoring Blends for Stunning Composite Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/creative-storytelling-in-podcasting-through-chatgpt-my-journey-and-lessons-learned/"><u>Creative Storytelling in Podcasting Through ChatGPT: My Journey and Lessons Learned</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/cutting-edge-ai-engines-revolutionizing-internet-information-access/"><u>Cutting-Edge AI Engines Revolutionizing Internet Information Access</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/decoding-copilot-vs-copilot-pro-discovering-differences-and-advantages-that-justify-an-upgrade/"><u>Decoding Copilot Vs.

The Mac Studio is clearly intended to replace the iMac but, of course, it lacks the integrated 5K display that was a key feature of the 27-inch iMac’s design – and also a key factor in its popularity. </p><p>The new Studio Display is clearly intended to fill that gap, but its high price – almost as expensive as the all-in-one iMac itself – and some initial teething problems mean that it hasn’t had the same warm welcome as the Mac Studio. </p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MPoakxUNf9o?si=S-ppSqzHzN9VrxC7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-options"><a href="#Price-options" class="headerlink" title="Price &amp; options"></a>Price &amp; options</h2><p>Until it was recently discontinued, Apple’s 27-inch iMac had a starting price of $1,799, which of course included the 5K display along with the iMac’s CPU, GPU, RAM and storage. </p><p>In contrast, the new Studio Display provides only a 5K screen, with a starting price of $1,599. That price includes either a VESA mount adapter or a basic stand that allows you to adjust the tilt of the screen, but not the height. If you want to adjust the height of the screen – and many people do – then you either balance it on a pile of books, or pay an additional $400 for Apple’s tilt- and height-adjustable stand. Neither stand supports swivel, though. There’s also an option to choose a glare-reducing ‘Nano-texture’ glass panel, which costs an additional $300. </p><p>Needless to say, these prices – ranging from $1,599 to $2,299 – have not met with universal approval. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2MlLvGxMwI?si=q_blGjXyJrGtzT8d" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-features"><a href="#Design-features" class="headerlink" title="Design &amp; features"></a>Design &amp; features</h2><p>The 18mm thick Studio Display, mounted on the standard tilt-only stand.</p><p>Image: Cliff Joseph &#x2F; ZDNet</p><p>The design of the Studio Display clearly follows the lead of last year’s revamped <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-imac-with-4-5k-retina-display-all-in-one-m1-8-gb-ssd-256-gb-led-24-us-mgpc3lla/" >M1-based 24-inch iMac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with the former’s slimline 27-inch screen measuring just 18mm (0.71in.) thick. </p><p>The panel has much narrower bezels than earlier iMac models, reducing the overall size of the screen to 623mm wide, 478mm high and 168mm deep, when mounted on the basic tilt-only stand (24.5in. x 18.8in. x 6.6in.). It has sharper corners – Apple’s current design fetish – than the 27-inch iMac, but in many respects the screen panel is very similar to that of the old iMac. </p><p>That’s no bad thing, as the 5K (5120 x 2880, 217.6ppi) resolution provides a bright, sharp image with bold colours and, as with the iMac, there’s support for the <a class="link"   href="https://www.displaymate.com/Display%5FColor%5FGamuts%5F1.htm" >DCI-P3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> colour standard used in professional video editing. The image quality will certainly be suitable for a wide range of graphics and design applications, as well as general office use, and the Mac’s Display Preferences panel provides a simple pull-down menu that allows you to select a variety of colour presets suitable for different tasks and workflows. </p><p>Colour presets for different tasks and workflows on the Studio Display.</p><p>Image: Cliff Joseph &#x2F; ZDNet</p><p>The Studio Display is also brighter than the iMac – 600 nits, rather than the 500 nits for the iMac – but it doesn’t support HDR, or the 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate of the latest iPhone and iPad models, so it isn’t quite the state-of-the-art display that Apple seems to think it is. </p><p>Ironically, perhaps, the Studio Display is redeemed by the additional features that complement the screen itself. </p><p>The Studio Display has one Thunderbolt 3 port and three USB-C ports at the back.</p><p>Image: Cliff Joseph &#x2F; ZDNet </p><p>The display has a Thunderbolt 3 port on the back that’s used to connect it to a host Mac, and this also provides 96W charging for a laptop if required. </p><p>There are also three USB-C ports on the Studio Display for connecting peripherals and accessories, which is certainly handy, although similar USB hubs are commonplace on many modern monitors. Oddly, we found that the Studio Display wouldn’t work with a Windows PC that also had Thunderbolt 3 when using the Thunderbolt cable provided by Apple. However, a third-party Thunderbolt 4 cable did seem to work with no problems. </p><p>Image: Apple</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hZsnjxeSh1U?si=hZIfzQPDNX5KtOCg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Sound-vision"><a href="#Sound-vision" class="headerlink" title="Sound &amp; vision"></a>Sound &amp; vision</h2><p>Despite its compact design, the Studio Display manages to squeeze in a six-speaker system, with four woofers and two tweeters, which delivers impressive sound quality – and very respectable bass – given the limited amount of space available inside the slimline screen panel. </p><p>With an eye on the ‘new normal’ and hybrid working, the Studio Display also houses a 12MP webcam and three microphones for video conferencing. Under the control of Apple’s A13 Bionic processor (the same chipset used in the entry-level iPad), these provide features such as Centre Stage, which enables the camera to automatically pan so that it keeps you in the centre of the image at all times. That’s helpful if you need to move around during a video call, perhaps while giving a presentation. The A13 Bionic also controls the beam-forming microphones, allowing them to follow you as you move around and to reduce background noise. </p><p>A height-adjustable stand will add $400 to the Studio Display’s price.</p><p>Image: Apple</p><p>Note though, that these features will only work with Macs running MacOS Monterey 12.3 or later, or with iPads running iPadOS 15.4 or later, and won’t work with any Windows PC that you hook up to the Studio Display. </p><p>However, there have been reports of problems with the image quality of the webcam, prompting Apple to promise a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-claims-studio-display-webcam-issues-will-be-fixed-via-software-update/" >software update <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that will address the issue. To be fair, the webcam in the Studio Display was noticeably brighter and sharper than the 720p webcam in my ageing MacBook Air, but there was a noticeable graininess that seemed to be overlaid on the image, which clearly needs to be addressed. It’s strange that a company with Apple’s love for eye-candy could overlook such a visible problem. </p><p>Using the webcam for video calls also emphasised the fact that the standard Studio Display doesn’t allow you to adjust the height of the display (or swivel it either, for that matter), which proved irksome while trying to adjust viewing angles. As noted above, a stand with 105mm (4.13in.) of height adjustment will cost you $400 extra. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-studio-display&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Apple Studio Display $1,599 at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXLLPY11of0?si=-3YNnpnO0wbc0K_-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusions"><a href="#Conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h2><p>The Studio Display is an attractive external monitor for use with a desktop or laptop Mac, complemented by extra video conferencing-oriented features and an impressive six-speaker system. It’s far less expensive than Apple’s 6K Pro Display XDR, which starts at $4,999, and is clearly aimed at the existing iMac user base, and people who are now working from home, rather than users of the high-end (and still, for now, Intel-based) Mac Pro. </p><p>However, the Studio Display still seems over-priced – even when compared to Apple’s own iMac, let alone <a class="link"

But if you’re one of the many who are planning to buy an Ultra wearable for the first time, this is as good as it gets. Here’s why.</p><p>Given today’s economic environment with rising consumer prices, I am a bit surprised that Apple was able to hold the price of the new Watch Ultra 2 at the same level as last year. When you consider the titanium construction, integrated LTE radio, and sapphire glass display, $799 is very reasonable for a high-performance sports watch. That’s more true when you compare the Apple Watch Ultra 2 to other flagship GPS sports watches. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>As far as what’s new with the model, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 incorporates a faster S9 processor, a brighter display, twice the internal storage, and a series of recycled materials that, somehow, don’t make the wearable feel any bit worse. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-issues-emergency-security-updates-for-iphone-ipad-and-apple-watch/" >Apple issues security fixes for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch to fight Predator spyware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>WatchOS 10 was released when the Watch Ultra 2 was announced and it’s made the Apple Watch experience an absolute joy to use, with new functions for the side button and digital crown (Smart Stack), along with spacious and info-rich watch faces that are optimized for the Watch Ultra models.</p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Naturally, I placed the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-vs-ultra/" >Watch Ultra 2 next to my first-gen Watch Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and they were virtually indistinguishable from each other.

But in the outdoors, which is where you’ll be leveraging the Watch Ultra’s technologies the most, it was apparent that the Ultra 2 was significantly brighter (3,000 nits compared to 2,000 nits).</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-tips-2023/" >Apple pro tips: The best new features in iPhone 15, iOS 17, and Apple Watch unlocked <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Prior to the Watch Ultra 2 launch, I listed <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-three-features-that-would-make-me-upgrade-from-the-last-model/" >three features that I wanted to see <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to warrant an upgrade, and while Apple did not provide them, it did address one of my desires in a unique manner. The LED flashlight on <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-garmin-watch/" >Garmin watches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a tool that I use daily. On the Watch Ultra 2, once you turn on the flashlight, spinning the digital crown now ups the maximum brightness, making use of the extra nits. </p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>It still doesn’t beat out the Garmin LED, but it is much more practical than last year’s for finding things in the garage or under the bed, illuminating rooms at night, and finding your way in the dark outside.</p><p>Mapping, unfortunately, is still limited on the Apple Watch Ultra 2, with the most notable change being offline maps support, provided you have an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-every-iphone-that-will-get-ios-17/" >iPhone on iOS 17 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. However, the Compass app has also received a subtle yet significant upgrade thanks to watchOS 10. On the Watch Ultra 2, it now shows a waypoint for the last-detected cellular and emergency SOS locations, so you know exactly where to return to if you find yourself in a dead zone. The Compass app also lets you mark your camping spot, parking spot, and other useful waypoints.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apple-weaved-ai-into-the-iphone-15-and-apple-watch-9/" >How Apple weaved AI into the iPhone 15 and Apple Watch 9 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Alongside Watch Ultra 2, Apple released new carbon-neutral watch bands, with three colors being offered across the Alpine Loop and Trail Loop bands. I had a chance to test the gray&#x2F;green Trail Loop with the Watch Ultra 2, and all I can say is that it’s extremely comfortable. I bought my Watch Ultra with an Ocean band last year but will likely pick up the Trail Loop this time around due to its easy Velcro secure support. For more casual outings, it’s the ideal watch band.</p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Finally, as much as I enjoy the Apple Watch Ultra 2 for its long battery life, brighter display, expanded connectivity, and new watch bands, I’ve also been enjoying the improved mental health functionality via the Mindfulness app. It has now earned a prominent spot in my app list, and I’ve been entering my state of mind on a daily basis. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-watchos-10-feature-is-overlooked-underrated-and-life-changing/" >My favorite WatchOS 10 feature is overlooked, underrated, and life-changing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I now frequently use the Reflect and Breathe utilities, which have slowly but surely reduced my stress, proving to be a welcome addition to my Apple Watch use. (Of course, you only need an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> running on watchOS 10 to use the Mindfulness app. I just like using it on the larger display of the Ultra!)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HSFNIAYChbA?si=4TIlsUrYmY5vP2il" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ZDNET’s-buying-advice"><a href="#ZDNET’s-buying-advice" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET’s buying advice"></a>ZDNET’s buying advice</h2><p>With my primary SIM now living as an eSIM in the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro/6.7-inch-display-256gb-natural-titanium-unlocked&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 Pro Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHX9N594?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ccf051f5e-8c27-4aef-8ea0-13f4f3fd2a79%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Apple Watch Ultra 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be staying on my wrist for an extended period of time – likely until the next Ultra version comes out. Apple’s improvements this year don’t push the envelope in any particular way, but they’re well-rounded enough to make the Watch Ultra still the best flagship sports watch that enthusiasts should buy.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/" >The best smartwatches of 2023: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If you don’t have an Apple Watch Ultra but are interested in buying one, the Ultra 2 is the best option.

The 8GB or 16GB of RAM can also be paired with up to 1TB of storage, to future-proof the machine. </p><p>Apple’s MacBook Air series are also perhaps one of the most popular ultraportable laptop families among consumers (and our pick for best overall ultraportable), having set an entirely new bar for performance with the introduction of Apple’s Silicon chips in 2020, and only improving since then.

Thinner yet with a larger screen than previous versions, the 2022 13.6-inch M2 MacBook Air also comes with a vibrant screen with up to 500-nits of brightness and a 60Hz refresh rate, a 1080p FaceTime webcam, two USB-C Thunderbolt ports, and the coveted 3.5mm headphone jack.

Just like iPhones and cases, Apple Watches can be upgraded and customized for many situations, from casual to dressy, thanks to their interchangeable watch bands. </p><p>I’ve been an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> user for a few years now, and I recently upgraded from a Series 3 watch to the latest <a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-SE-2nd-Gen-GPS-40mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-Sport-Band-S-M-Fitness-Sleep-Tracker-Crash-Detection-Heart-Rate-Monitor/5033741510?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Watch SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Over the last several months, I’ve embarked on a journey to test Apple Watch bands from brands like Apple, Nomad, Spigen, and more, to find the best watch bands made of materials ranging from stainless steel to fabric to leather. I’ve also included input from other ZDNET experts who frequently try different watch bands and switch up their looks and consulted staff and customer reviews for bands across the market. Every pick on this list is backed by hands-on testing  staff. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/"><strong>The best Apple Watches you can buy</strong></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What’s-the-best-Apple-Watch-band-right-now"><a href="#What’s-the-best-Apple-Watch-band-right-now" class="headerlink" title="What’s the best Apple Watch band right now?"></a>What’s the best Apple Watch band right now?</h2><p>After months of wearing different bands during my daily activities and considering the rest of the ZDNET staff’s extensive hands-on analysis of watch bands, my pick for the best Apple Watch band overall is <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-band-black" >Nomad’s Sport Band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> thanks to its comfortable and breathable wear and its numerous color choices, including limited edition drops, for a nice upgrade over the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWMR3AM/A/41mm-soft-mint-sport-band-s-m?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >plain sports band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that came with my Apple Watch.</p><p>Not looking for a sport band pick?

It is designed for intense workouts and everyday wear. Plus, it’s 100% waterproof, so you can wear it as you exercise in rain, sleet, or snow without worrying about damage. Its lightweight design that encourages ventilation has also solved my sweaty gym wrists (if you know, you know). </p><p>If you’re looking to purchase a sport band or you love Nomad’s bands, we recommend keeping an eye on their website because the company regularly offers Limited Edition models with cool colors and styles (including the one pictured above on my Apple Watch SE). These historically sell out quickly, so if you see a limited edition offering, it’s smart to make your purchase quickly.</p><p>I tested the Nomad Sport band in the limited edition glow-in-the-dark Glow 2.0 design, and I was impressed with how similar it felt and performed to my original Apple sport band. Although not every sport band features this fun glow, they all offer the same features. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nomads-glow-in-the-dark-iphone-case-just-sold-out-but-its-alternatives-are-just-as-good/"><strong>Nomad’s glow-in-the-dark iPhone case just sold out, but its alternatives are just as good</strong></a></p><p>When I tested the Nomad sport band, I liked the durable yet comfortable material, the numerous color options available, the customizable adjustability, and the overall look of the band. Getting the band initially secured was a little difficult, but over time, I got it on and off quickly. It’s a nice upgrade from the standard Apple band, and should work for most people. Since it offers more notch options, it felt more secure on my wrist than the Apple sport band, and I felt it stayed cleaner than my Apple band typically does. </p><p>I only have two issues with this band. The first is that after a few weeks of wear, the coating on the stainless steel pin started coming off, although it isn’t noticeable unless I look very closely. Secondly, despite the numerous color options, I wish Nomad offered more, like some softer pastels.</p><p>Nomad sport band customers on <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16ldce5/are%5Fnomad%5Fstraps%5Fany%5Fgood/" >Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> said they liked the quality, color options (including limited edition designs), and overall value of the band. Some customers said the band did not sit flush with the Apple Watch Ultra, and one customer said the stainless steel pin broke off their band (although they reported customer service promptly replaced their purchase). </p><p><strong>Nomad Sport Band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Fluoroelastomer rubber | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch Ultra, Series 9, 8, 7, 6, SE, and all previous versions of Apple Watch | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 45mm&#x2F;49mm or 40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://burga.sjv.io/c/159047/1270603/15631?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%253A%252F%252Fus.burga.com%252Fproducts%252Fall-eyes-on-me-apple-watch-band&subId1=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp" >View now at Burga <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Two-tone design</li><li>Similar feel to jewelry watch</li><li>Clasp closure</li><li>Affordable luxury</li><li>Adjustable</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Clasp can sometimes clip skin</li><li>Requires careful wear&#x2F;proper care</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kiW7sLvL65k?si=IHSeRFsYCrfqpn2o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Burga-Stainless-Steel-Two-Tone-Apple-Watch-Band"><a href="#Burga-Stainless-Steel-Two-Tone-Apple-Watch-Band" class="headerlink" title="Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch Band"></a>Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch Band</h2><h3 id="Best-metal-Apple-Watch-band-for-style"><a href="#Best-metal-Apple-Watch-band-for-style" class="headerlink" title="Best metal Apple Watch band for style"></a>Best metal Apple Watch band for style</h3><p>Since I began exploring Apple watch bands, I’ve been searching for one that I can use to dress up my everyday look. This Burga watch band offers a two-tone stainless steel strap and an easy clasp closure. The inside is designed for comfort, and the band can support everyday wear and tear.</p><p>When I tested this Burga watch over a few weeks, I was immediately impressed with its overall appearance. It looked expensive and of quality, echoing the same look as a non-smart watch. It has a nice weight, and it was easy to follow the adjustment instructions to fit it to my wrist. </p><p>Throughout testing, I received several compliments on this band – which doesn’t often happen despite the number of products I test through my work, and I was happy with the affordable luxury look it gave my Watch SE. I had no issues with tarnishing or chipping after my few weeks of wear, although I was careful around water, did not wear the band while applying lotion, makeup, or perfume, and used a jewelry cloth to wipe it down every few wears or so. I also did not wear this band during intense workouts, but it was fine during my casual walks, usually 3-5 miles daily. </p><p>With proper care, this watch band offers great value. It looks much more expensive than it is, and it is worth the money if you’re looking to switch up your look for a special occasion or a few times a week. It is slightly pricier than bands made of less expensive materials but significantly less expensive than titanium options. </p><p>Current Burga customers said they liked this watch band’s overall design and quality, with some saying it looks and feels like an affordable luxury. </p><p><strong>Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Stainless steel | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> No | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> All current Apple Watch models | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 42mm&#x2F;44mm&#x2F;45mm&#x2F;49mm or 38mm&#x2F;40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-slim-band-white-41mm" >View now at Nomad Goods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Durable</li><li>High quality</li><li>Interior ventilation</li><li>Slim profile</li><li>Good for small wrists</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Limited color options</li><li>Slight wear on stainless steel pin</li><li>A little pricey</li></ul><h2 id="Nomad-Slim-Sport-Band"><a href="#Nomad-Slim-Sport-Band" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Slim Sport Band"></a>Nomad Slim Sport Band</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FWCFI3f_cs?si=Kt2Onr_E4c616tbH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-slim-everyday-Apple-Watch-band"><a href="#Best-slim-everyday-Apple-Watch-band" class="headerlink" title="Best slim everyday Apple Watch band"></a>Best slim everyday Apple Watch band</h3><p>Nomad’s slim sport band is a thinner version of the brand’s sport band. Though it features a similar design, material, and overall feel, the slim band has a thinner construction and a smaller overall look on the wearer’s wrist. </p><p>Like the classic sport band, the slim band is 100% waterproof, features a lightweight design that encourages ventilation, and is made of the same durable material. I was able to test the slim sport band for several weeks with my Apple Watch SE in starlight, and I liked how similar in color and feel it was to the Apple-issue sport band that came with my watch. </p><p>When I tested the band, I was also impressed with how secure the stainless steel pin kept the watch despite its more delicate profile. I prefer the slim band over Nomad’s classic sport band for everyday wear, though I can understand why this style may not be the best for someone with larger wrists or a desire for a more prominent watch band. </p><p>Like the sport band, it was a little tough to put on at first, but it became easier to do so the more I wore it. I have also seen some chipping on the stainless steel pin’s coating, and like with the sport band, I wish there were more color options. Since the slim band is my preferred style, it’s a bit of a disappointment that there are only four color options, especially when the larger sport band has quite a bit more and limited edition offerings. I’d love to see more punchy colors and some soft pastels in the slim band – it’s a great option for often smaller women’s wrists. </p><p>Regardless of my feelings about the color selection, I enjoyed testing the slim band, and since then, I’ve been frequently wearing it in my daily activities. </p><p><strong>Nomad Slim Sport Band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Fluoroelastomer rubber | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch Ultra, Series 9, 8, 7, 6, SE, and all previous versions of Apple Watch <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 45mm&#x2F;49mm or 40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.spigen.com/products/apple-watch-series-band-liquid-crystal-pro" >View now at Spigen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Crytal-Designed-Crystal/dp/B098SX92FT?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cf4142531-1ed4-4f98-8c0a-beb247fccf63%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Truly clear</li><li>Case and band combo</li><li>Easy to take on and off</li><li>Easy to insert watch</li><li>Affordable</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Needs breaking in</li><li>Silicone not the most malleable</li></ul><h2 id="Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Pro-Apple-Watch-Case-and-Band"><a href="#Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Pro-Apple-Watch-Case-and-Band" class="headerlink" title="Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch Case and Band"></a>Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch Case and Band</h2><h3 id="Best-clear-Apple-Watch-case-and-band"><a href="#Best-clear-Apple-Watch-case-and-band" class="headerlink" title="Best clear Apple Watch case and band"></a>Best clear Apple Watch case and band</h3><p>Spigen’s Liquid Proband is both an Apple watch strap and a case in one. Simply pop in your Apple Watch and fasten it to your wrist – you don’t have to deal with sliding any bands in. The Liquid Pro is available in crystal clear and black space clear colors. </p><p>It is made of soft silicone for comfort, fastens with a traditional buckle, and features a unibody design. I wasn’t expecting to like this band and case combo as much as I did. While I don’t think I’d consider this for myself for everyday wear, this is a great option for kids thanks to its all-in-one approach or for those looking to minimize the appearance of their watch thanks to the crystal clear design. </p><p>When I tested this watch band over a few months, I liked how easy it was to pop my watch in and out of this case yet how secure it remained. I also liked that the built-in case provided extra protection around my watch. The watch band itself is pretty comfortable overall, though the silicone wasn’t extremely malleable and is still a bit stiff. I predict that over more daily wear, it will eventually contour more to one’s wrist, but it definitely needs breaking in. </p><p><strong>Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Silicone | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 40mm&#x2F;44mm&#x2F;45mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://www.nike.com/w/apple-watch-nike-sport-band-7dq6d" >View now at Nike <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUV53AM/A/45mm-midnight-sky-nike-sport-band-m-l&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Comfortable</li><li>Breathes well</li><li>Durable</li><li>Fun colors</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Dust and residue collect in the holes</li><li>Requires cleaning</li></ul><h2 id="Nike-Apple-Watch-Sport-Band"><a href="#Nike-Apple-Watch-Sport-Band" class="headerlink" title="Nike Apple Watch Sport Band"></a>Nike Apple Watch Sport Band</h2><h3 id="Best-classic-Apple-Watch-band-alternative"><a href="#Best-classic-Apple-Watch-band-alternative" class="headerlink" title="Best classic Apple Watch band alternative"></a>Best classic Apple Watch band alternative</h3><p>Nike’s flagship sports band is the athletic brand’s take on the classic Apple sports band.

Often, Apple Watch bands from third-party brands are sized according to the display size of your watch, such as 40mm, 45mm, 49mm, etc, but they are not necessarily your watch model. Some bands may also have wrist-size options, such as Apple’s flagship sport bands, which are S&#x2F;M and M&#x2F;L, but other options don’t specify wrist sizes (they ensure adjustability for a great fit). Be sure you know what band size and potentially what wrist size you need.</li><li><strong>Durability</strong>: A purchase is hardly worth it if your Apple Watch band breaks or cracks, so it’s important to consider the long-term durability while searching for watch bands. We don’t want you to waste your cash on cheap options, so we’ve tested the picks on this list before recommending them.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: As with other purchases, what you’re willing to spend is critical. Establishing a budget can help narrow down your search parameters and ensure you’re purchasing within your comfort range. Keep in mind that the material will often drive the cost of Apple Watch bands up. Several metal band options on this list, particularly the titanium options, are over $100.</li><li><strong>Comfort:</strong> If you’re purchasing a watch band, you might want it to be comfortable. When I tested watch bands over the last several months, I considered comfort on my own wrist before recommending anything on this list. Your watch band must be secure, too, especially if you’re using your watch during intense workouts or for heart rate monitoring.</li></ul><h2 id="How-did-we-test-these-best-Apple-Watch-bands"><a href="#How-did-we-test-these-best-Apple-Watch-bands" class="headerlink" title="How did we test these best Apple Watch bands?"></a>How did we test these best Apple Watch bands?</h2><p>We went hands-on with every Apple Watch band on this list before selecting and recommending our picks. I conducted hands-on testing over several months on over a dozen watch bands and incorporated even more analysis and hands-on testing  staff. </p><p>We spent time wearing these bands in our day-to-day lives, during work, errands, workouts, and more to get a feel for each band’s comfort, security, adjustability, and more – not just for a day or two, but over the course of a few weeks to really get a feel for each product’s add-in value. Can you “add” this product into your life and benefit from its presence, or is it just another fad product that’s too good to be true or collects dust after the buzz wears off? </p><p>If we think another product is worth your money, we’ll update this list or write up a spotlight review highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it’s for. </p><p>Plus, we routinely scour the web for new products worthy of testing, follow news on product rollouts and upgrades, and source the best deals. We know buying anything in the current economy is not just for your whims, and that’s why this list, as well as our other advice, is tailored to your needs, wants, and budget. Our picks are expert-tested and expert-vetted. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKZUYice-ws?si=L8iMa9T3h7TMSWdQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-do-I-know-what-size-Apple-Watch-band-to-buy"><a href="#How-do-I-know-what-size-Apple-Watch-band-to-buy" class="headerlink" title="How do I know what size Apple Watch band to buy?"></a>How do I know what size Apple Watch band to buy?</h2><p>Before buying the best Apple Watch band for your Apple Watch, you need to know which size to buy. If you are not sure, Apple provides a convenient <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/shop/Catalog/US/Images/bxxd/size-guide%5FCA.pdf" >sizing template <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you can use to check sizing. However, most bands today from non-Apple brands are adjustable and customizable for fit, so the band size isn’t of consideration. I only needed to remove links for the metal options I tested the last few months – for every other band option, I could self-adjust easily. </p><p>The most important factor is to confirm that your Apple Watch works with your chosen band to ensure a seamless fit when putting the two together. This means if you have a 49mm watch, you want to look for a band that specifies that size. Essentially, just know what model and display size you purchased for your watch, and you’ll be okay. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVsiIO7hWOc?si=UvWnqxaI_yHwEr74" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-much-do-the-best-Apple-Watch-bands-cost"><a href="#How-much-do-the-best-Apple-Watch-bands-cost" class="headerlink" title="How much do the best Apple Watch bands cost?"></a>How much do the best Apple Watch bands cost?</h2><p>The cost of Apple Watch bands can run the gamut, ranging from around $30 to upwards of hundreds of dollars. Many metal bands can easily bring you into the hundreds – Nomad’s titanium band is a whopping $300, and iterations of Apple’s Milanese Loop can get pricey, too. However, most of the picks on this list are under $100 and sit comfortably between the $30-$80 range.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jf0JvOqiAXc?si=kHEHQGC_PhBv4xij" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-the-different-Apple-Watch-bands-available-from-Apple"><a href="#What-are-the-different-Apple-Watch-bands-available-from-Apple" class="headerlink" title="What are the different Apple Watch bands available from Apple?"></a>What are the different Apple Watch bands available from Apple?</h2><p>Apple offers several band options that are included with its watches, some dependent on the model purchased.

It features an adjustable stand with 8 configurations, a bumper and rugged shell for added drop protection, a stylus pocket, wireless charging capabilities, and more. Plus, Zugu has cases available for preorder for the new M4 iPad Pro models. </p><p>I tested this Zugu case on my iPad Air (pictured above) for the past few weeks along with several other cases, it’s my favorite. It’s extremely functional but still practical, providing true security from bumps and drops (not just operating as a light cover). I loved using it as a stand, especially while testing several note-taking apps this month. The material feels premium and expensive with a clean, appealing design. </p><p>And while the functionality is top-notch, my favorite thing about the Zugu case is the color. I’ve been using the case in the Desert Rose color, and as a true Gen-Z corporate girl, I love it. Many companies don’t cater to colors outside of black, white, tan, and brown, so the unique color choices are awesome, but I still wish there were more fun prints and designs. The new iPad Pro model cases also have limited colors for now, but I expect to see more soon.</p><p>Current customers on the Zugu website said they like the overall protection, functionality, quality, and aesthetic of the Zugu case. Many said the case is a great value and has a premium feel, and one customer even said they wished they’d found Zugu sooner. </p><p>What’s even better is that Zugu will pay a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zugucase.com/pages/free-ipad-repairs" >one-time AppleCare+ repair fee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if your iPad is damaged while in a Zugu case. The Zugu case is well worth the money in my opinion, and it’s a solid all-around case for style and protection.</p><p><strong>Zugu iPad Pro Case features:</strong> Adjustable stand with 8 angles | Bumper and rugged shell for drop protection | Air flow vents | Secure magnetic mount capability | Microfiber interior | Auto sleep&#x2F;wake magnetic cover | Stylus pocket on back | Wireless Apple Pencil charging compatibility | Free AppleCare+ Repair Fee</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://burga.sjv.io/c/159047/1270603/15631?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%253A%252F%252Fus.burga.com%252Fproducts%252Fmath-exam-ipad-pro-12-9-6th-5th-gen-case%253Fvariant%253D47811892412744%2526type%253DFolio&subId1=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp" >View now at Burga <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Fun designs and patterns</li><li>Folio style</li><li>Apple Pencil storage&#x2F;charging</li><li>Doubles as stand</li><li>Under $100</li><li>Shock absorption</li><li>Raised bezel design</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Stand configurations could be more comfortable</li><li>Folio front feels a bit flimsy</li><li>No cases for new 13-inch iPad Pro</li></ul><h2 id="Burga-iPad-Pro-Case"><a href="#Burga-iPad-Pro-Case" class="headerlink" title="Burga iPad Pro Case"></a>Burga iPad Pro Case</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHafwnWSEQk?si=rejNVNpJZH2SqNLy" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-basic-iPad-Pro-case-for-style"><a href="#Best-basic-iPad-Pro-case-for-style" class="headerlink" title="Best basic iPad Pro case for style"></a>Best basic iPad Pro case for style</h3><p>Burga’s folio case for the iPad Pro combines style and function. It features a spot for stylus storage and Apple Pencil charging, has a hard shell backing and a soft close folio front, can be used as stand for your iPad, features shock absorption and a raised bezel design, and is overall sleek in profile. </p><p>When I tested the Burga case on the iPad Air the last few weeks (pictured above) I liked its light weight, handy Apple Pencil storage, folio style cover, stand configuration, and numerous prints and designs. It’s a great basic case to protect from everyday bumps and scratches, but I recommend bumping up to something more secure such as an Otterbox or even the Zugu case if you’re accident prone or are more rough around the edges when it comes to your tech. </p><p>I also wish the stand options on the case were a bit more comfortable for viewing, though it’s a nice add to have the option to prop up my iPad up at all while watching a show or video. For the $60 price tag though, I think this a great buy for the features you are getting, especially considering a similar folio case from Apple is now around $80 and ones at Casetify start at $92. </p><p>Current customers on the Burga website said they like the overall value of the case, with emphasis on the case’s design, build, and and quality.

Moft makes some of the most innovate, origami-inspired mobile and tech accessories I’ve seen. </p><p>The Moft Snap Float Folio case features a strong magnetic connection with a sleek and slim design that makes the case feel elevated and premium. The stylus holder is a plus, and the case configures into three different angled positions. One standing position is an ultra high alignment (as pictured) which lifts your iPad up above much of the competitors. </p><p>The case is a duo system, so you can customize which parts you want to use at any given time. There’s a soft outside folio and a hard case set for extra protection. They can be used individually or together, and it’s easy to change. I tested the Moft case for the last month on my iPad Air, and I especially liked the standing configuration, which allowed it to be eye-level. It’s perfect for working from home or personal video calls. I also enjoyed the premium look and feel, which is certainly more elevated than some other case options on this list. One downside right now is there is no iPad Pro 13-inch case available.</p><p>Current Moft Float Folio users said they like the overall design and quality feel of the case, as well as the functionality thanks to the unique stand configurations. One customer even said Moft cases deserved more hype than they get. “It’s the best case and holder ever. The quality of materials is great, the finishes are great. You can put it in any position you’re thinking of and your iPad is very well protected too. Simply the best.

Check the size of the case to ensure that it will fit your iPad model, so it won’t be too small or too large.</li><li><strong>Build:</strong> iPad cases and covers can be made out of many different materials. The best iPad Pro cases and covers incorporate durable materials like rubber and polycarbonate plastic.

You don’t want to purchase a case that doesn’t fit your wants and needs.</li><li><strong>Design:</strong> Why not add a little style to your iPad Pro? Many of the best iPad Pro cases and covers are available in a variety of different colors and patterns so you can add a splash of personality to your everyday carry, if that’s what you’re looking for.</li><li><strong>Budget:</strong> There are many affordable iPad Pro cases available, but there are also some that cost well over $100, depending on the design and features.

Following Apple’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-releases-ios-17-5-heres-what-it-offers-and-why-you-should-update/" >iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 updates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, photos that users had deleted years earlier were resurfacing, even on devices that users had wiped clean.</p><p>Last week, Apple <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-17-5-1-patches-cringey-bug-that-was-resurrecting-old-deleted-photos/" >issued a patch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which the company said “provides important bug fixes and addresses a rare issue where photos that experienced database corruption could reappear in the Photos library even if they were deleted.” The bug only affected a small number of users and a small number of photos, Apple said, but for those users, it was pretty unsettling.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-transfer-data-from-android-to-an-iphone/" >How to transfer data from Android to an iPhone: 2 quick and simple ways <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>While Apple initially blamed the issue on “database corruption,” the company is now explaining more precisely what caused the problem.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/23/apple-deleted-photos-resurfacing-explanation/" >Speaking to 9to5Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Apple elaborated that the issue wasn’t with iCloud Photos, but with the databases on the devices themselves. In short, the restored photos were ones <em>not</em> synced to the cloud. When a device was restored from a backup – or from a device-to-device transfer – some of those photos were restored as well (from the device backup, not from iCloud). </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you want to make sure your deleted photos are truly gone, here’s what Apple recommends you do. (Note: This is only for times when you want to wipe a device clean of everything.) Under Settings, head to General, and then “Transfer or Reset.” You’ll see an option to “Erase All Content and Settings.” Tap that, and everything on your phone will be deleted, with no chance of your data coming back in the future.</p><p>Apple says that the once-deleted, now-resurrected photos will not automatically be deleted again. You’ll need to manually go in and remove them yourself.</p><h4 id="See-also"><a href="#See-also" class="headerlink" title="See also"></a>See also</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-envy-five-ios-17-features-that-android-users-already-have/"  title="iPhone envy?

But as more people use the AI chatbot, it’s important to consider the security risks.</p><p> Like any technology, ChatGPT can be used for nefarious reasons. Hackers, for instance, can use it to create malicious content, like writing phony email messages to get access to your PC or even your bank account.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oB9V7rZzotw?si=d4xrCbq1jKHXGAWN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT-Can-Help-Cybercriminals-Hack-Your-PC"><a href="#ChatGPT-Can-Help-Cybercriminals-Hack-Your-PC" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Can Help Cybercriminals Hack Your PC"></a>ChatGPT Can Help Cybercriminals Hack Your PC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/laptop-with-chatgpt-site-on-screen.jpg"                      alt="Laptop with chatgpt site on screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_O8m9KphYzs?si=jITthzeyX_Kmt9X2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Hackers, including script kiddies, can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-be-used-malware-creation/" >use ChatGPT to create new malware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or improve existing ones. Some cybercriminals already use the chatbot, especially its earlier versions, to write code they claim can encrypt files.</p><p> To counter such use cases, OpenAI has implemented mechanisms to reject prompts asking ChatGPT to create malware. For instance, if you ask the chatbot to “write malware,” it won’t. Despite this, cybercriminals easily get around these content moderation barriers.</p><p> By acting as a pen tester, a threat actor may rephrase their prompts to trick ChatGPT into writing code, which they can then tweak and use in cyberattacks.</p><p> A<a class="link"   href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/opwnai-cybercriminals-starting-to-use-chatgpt/" >report by Check Point <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , an Israeli security company, indicates that a hacker could have used ChatGPT to create basic Infostealer malware. The security firm also discovered another user that claims ChatGPT helped him build a multi-layer encryption tool that can encrypt several files in a ransomware attack.</p><p> In a separate incident, the researchers prompted ChatGPT to generate malicious VBA code that could be implanted into a Microsoft Excel file that would infect your PC if opened; it successfully did. Plus, there are claims that ChatGPT can code malicious software capable of spying on your keyboard strokes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-66V-LRK3Y?si=fNeB2pXCePeQli6E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Can-ChatGPT-Hack-Your-Bank-Account"><a href="#Can-ChatGPT-Hack-Your-Bank-Account" class="headerlink" title="Can ChatGPT Hack Your Bank Account?"></a>Can ChatGPT Hack Your Bank Account?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/customer-service.jpg"                      alt="An illustration of a customer service chatbot"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmTJlcwgyrQ?si=x3hba82M0tT57fj7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Many data breaches start with<a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-phishing/" >a successful phishing attack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Phishing attacks often involve a malicious actor sending a recipient an email that contains legitimate-looking documents or links, which, when clicked on, can install malware on their device. In this way, code from ChatGPT doesn’t need to hack your bank account directly. Someone only needs to use ChatGPT to help them trick you into giving them access.</p><p> Fortunately, you can easily recognize most traditional phishing scams; grammatical errors, misspellings, and weird phrases often characterize them. But these are all mistakes that ChatGPT rarely makes, even when used to compose malicious emails for phishing scams.</p><p> When used in phishing scams, messages that appear to be from a legitimate source can make it easier for victims to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-personally-identifiable-information/" >give up their personally identifiable information <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , like banking passwords.</p><p> ​​​​​​​If your bank sent you a message via email, consider visiting the bank’s website directly instead of clicking on any embedded link. Clicking on random links and attachments, especially those asking you to log in somewhere, is rarely a good idea.</p><p> For phishing, it’s mostly about volume. ChatGPT can help boost phishing campaigns as it can quickly pump out huge amounts of natural-sounding texts that are tailored to specific audiences.</p><p> Another kind of phishing attack involving the use of ChatGPT is where a hacker creates a fake account on a popular chat platform like Discord and pretends to be a customer representative. The fake customer rep then contacts customers who have posted concerns and offers help. If a user falls for the trap, the cybercriminal will redirect them to a bogus website that tricks them into sharing personal information, like their bank login details.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rxyki8-Y630?si=dHLkIxG59zdlZeN0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Protect-Your-PC-and-Bank-Account-in-the-AI-Era"><a href="#Protect-Your-PC-and-Bank-Account-in-the-AI-Era" class="headerlink" title="Protect Your PC and Bank Account in the AI-Era"></a>Protect Your PC and Bank Account in the AI-Era</h2><p> ChatGPT is a powerful and valuable tool that can answer many questions you throw its way. But the chatbot can also be used for malicious purposes, like generating phishing messages and creating malware.</p><p> The good news is that OpenAI continues implementing measures that prevent users from exploiting ChatGPT by asking harmful prompts. Then again, threat actors keep finding new ways to bypass those restrictions.</p><p> To minimize the potential dangers of AI chatbots, it’s crucial to know their potential risks and the best possible security measures to protect yourself from hackers.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-audiences-delighted-best-editors-to-transform-youtube-shorts/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Audiences Delighted Best Editors to Transform Youtube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-the-road-less-filmed-journeying-into-the-heart-of-travel-vlogging-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Road Less Filmed Journeying Into the Heart of Travel Vlogging for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-integrating-obs-in-daily-skype-monitoring/"><u>2024 Approved Integrating OBS in Daily Skype Monitoring</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/discover-apples-most-recent-macbook-innovations/"><u>Discover Apple's Most Recent MacBook Innovations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/easy-ways-to-distribute-access-to-your-chatgpt-sessions/"><u>Easy Ways to Distribute Access to Your ChatGPT Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/educators-ai-scrutiny-guide-for-chatgpt/"><u>Educator's AI-Scrutiny Guide for ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/elevating-machine-learning-identifying-the-top-5-ai-prompt-generators/"><u>Elevating Machine Learning: Identifying the Top 5 AI Prompt Generators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/enhancing-siris-capabilities-on-your-iphone-through-chatgpt-integration/"><u>Enhancing Siri's Capabilities on Your iPhone Through ChatGPT Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/evaluating-the-performance-of-integrated-editing-tools-in-dall-e-3-version/"><u>Evaluating the Performance of Integrated Editing Tools in DALL-E 3 Version</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/exploring-four-key-methods-of-ai-regulation-by-authorities/"><u>Exploring Four Key Methods of AI Regulation by Authorities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/from-digital-inspiration-to-print-perfection-using-chatgpt-for-poetry-book-authorship/"><u>From Digital Inspiration to Print Perfection: Using ChatGPT for Poetry Book Authorship</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/how-to-easily-obtain-and-install-gigabyte-z370p-drivers-step-by-step-guide-with-downloads/"><u>How to Easily Obtain and Install Gigabyte Z370P Drivers - Step-by-Step Guide with Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-samsungs-competitors-top-gear-360-alternative-cameras-of-the-year/"><u>In 2024, Samsung’s Competitors Top Gear 360 Alternative Cameras of the Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/rolling-back-wireless-controller-firmware-series-xs/"><u>Rolling Back Wireless Controller Firmware Series X/S</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/transcription-facile-et-gratuite-convertissez-votre-fichier-opus-en-wma-a-laide-du-service-en-ligne-de-movavi/"><u>Transcription Facile Et Gratuite : Convertissez Votre Fichier OPUS en WMA À L'aide Du Service en Ligne De Movavi</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Having tried many, I’ve always come away feeling that most are poorly made or just inconvenient to use. Also, as summer approaches and temperatures rise, I know that charging my iPhone on a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-wireless-charger/" >wireless charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is going to become a hit or miss.  </p><p>Given how good I’ve found ESR charging devices to be, I decided to give the <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/ESR-HaloLock-CryoBoost-Compatible-Phone-Cooling/dp/B09Y5QX2CD/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cddb883e2-e80e-4b2d-a07c-118da332f3dc%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >HaloLock 3-in-1 for MagSafe Charging Station with CryoBoost <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> a try.

I’ve tested this previously on <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/is-this-the-ultimate-wireless-car-charger-my-iphone-tells-me-yes/" >ESR’s in-car iPhone charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it works really well. If the iPhone isn’t going to fall off inside a truck bouncing across rough roads, it’s not going to fall off on your nightstand. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The other word is “CryoBoost”. There’s a fan built into the wireless charging head to keep it cool in use. Again, this is <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/is-this-the-ultimate-wireless-car-charger-my-iphone-tells-me-yes/" >the same charging head that I tested in my truck in the hot sun <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it did an amazing job of keeping my iPhone cool while charging. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/is-this-the-ultimate-wireless-car-charger-my-iphone-tells-me-yes/" >Is this the ultimate wireless car charger? My iPhone tells me yes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I appreciate that this kit comes with a charger. Quite a few of the others I’ve tried require you to buy your own, which isn’t a huge problem. But having everything you need in the box is a nice touch and prevents confusion on the owner’s part. </p><p>Charger included.</p><p>Adrian Kingsley-Hughes&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Before you can charge your Apple Watch you will need to find your Apple Watch charger, as you’ll need to attach this to the charging station. </p><p>Now, previous ones I’ve tested have needed a USB-A version of the Apple Watch charger. I spent a good half hour looking for one before realizing that this charging station can accommodate both USB-A and USB-C flavors of the Apple Watch charging cable. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-keeps-selling-out-of-this-3-in-1-charging-cube-i-tested-one-to-see-if-its-worth-the-wait/"><strong>Apple keeps selling out of this 3-in-1 charging cube. I tested one to see if it’s worth the wait</strong></a> </p><p>To fit the Apple Watch charging cable, you need to unclip the base and thread the charging cable into the slot cut in the base. And I have to say, I’m impressed by the precision of this slot. </p><p>I mean, take a look at it. </p><p>The precision of the slot of the Apple Watch charging cable is impressive.</p><p>Adrian Kingsley-Hughes&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Another feature that I appreciate is the sleep mode feature. Too many nightstand charging stations are a Christmas tree of eye-piercing LED lights. A single button on this charging station turns off the LEDs and the fan, ensuring that you have a good night’s sleep. </p><p>As I said earlier, I’ve been using this charging station for several weeks now, and I’ve had no problem at all. The charger unit is sturdy and made very well, the magnets do a fine job of holding the iPhone and AirPods Pro in place, and the unit charges everything just as you’d expect. Oh, and night mode means you don’t have to try to sleep next to a pile of glowing LEDs. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-accessory/"><strong>The best
