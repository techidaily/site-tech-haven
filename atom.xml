Rather, Apple is now moving further into AI language models. </p><p>Last Thursday, Apple released <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/apple/DCLM-7B" >DCLM-Baseline-7B <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a 7 billion parameter language model, on Hugging Face. The model is part of the DataComp for Language Models (DCLM) benchmark, an initiative to improve the quality of training datasets for language models.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-try-gpt-4o-mini-3-ways-to-access-the-smarter-cheaper-ai-model-and-2-are-free/" >Want to try GPT-4o mini? 3 ways to access the smarter, cheaper AI model - and 2 are free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>At 7 billion parameters, this model is comparable to popular models such as Llama 2, Gemma, and more. When tested on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark against popular models around the same size, DCLM-Baseline-7B performed competitively, even outperforming Mistral 7B, as seen below. </p><p>Apple&#x2F;Hugging Face</p><p>Despite its impressive performance, one of the DCLM-Baseline-7B’s biggest standouts is that the model is truly open-sourced, with “open data, open weight models, open training code,” as highlighted by Vaishaal Shankar, a research scientist at Apple. </p><blockquote><p>We have released our DCLM models on huggingface! To our knowledge these are by far the best performing truly open-source models (open data, open weight models, open training code) 1&#x2F;5</p><p>— Vaishaal Shankar (@Vaishaal) <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/Vaishaal/status/1813956553042711006?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" >July 18, 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></blockquote><p>Many are commending Apple for this approach as it allows other researchers and developers to build on the models and further grow advancements in the space. The model was trained on the <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlfoundations/dclm-baseline-1.0" >DCLM-BASELINE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> data, combined with <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/starcoderdata" >StarCoder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="http://proofpile2/" >ProofPile2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>data, to reach proficiency in other tasks such as coding and math.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-can-be-updated-to-apples-new-ios-18-public-beta-and-which-ones-cant/" >Every iPhone model that can be updated to Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones can’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In addition to releasing DCLM-Baseline-7B, model weights, training code, and dataset, Apple also included a powerful 1.4 billion parameter version in the package. </p><p>This isn’t Apple’s first go-around with AI models, having released others such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-model-can-understand-your-home-screen-and-supercharge-siri/" >Ferret-UI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a multimodal large language model (MLLM), and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-claims-its-on-device-ai-system-realm-substantially-outperforms-gpt-4/" >Reference Resolution As Language Modeling (ReALM) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a conversational AI system.

A two-finger swipe down from the top of the screen was all it took.”</p><p>OnePlus also sells a keyboard case and a stylus for the OnePlus Pad, which more or less turns the OnePlus Pad into an iPad Pro dupe.

You move it by double tapping in the blank space on either side of it.”</p><p>Not only is the app experience better with the Pixel Tablet, but it pulls double duty acting as a smart home hub when it’s not in use thanks to the included Charging Speaker Dock. The $129 accessory (if you want to buy extras) has a built-in speaker that ups the bass by 4x, while enabling a hub mode feature that effectively makes the Pixel Tablet more like a Nest Hub, instead of a tablet. </p><p>Unfortunately, right now, there isn’t any sort of official keyboard or stylus for those who want to get some work done on the Pixel Tablet.

For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.</li></ul><p>For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tablet testing methodology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><h2 id="What-does-it-mean-if-a-tablet-is-Wi-Fi-only"><a href="#What-does-it-mean-if-a-tablet-is-Wi-Fi-only" class="headerlink" title="What does it mean if a tablet is Wi-Fi only?"></a>What does it mean if a tablet is Wi-Fi only?</h2><p>When a tablet says it is “Wi-Fi Only,” it requires a wireless internet connection to access things like email, websites, and apps. There are models available that give you the option to use LTE cellular data to connect to the internet, but if you aren’t planning on traveling with your tablet, you can stick to a Wi-Fi only model.</p><h2 id="Is-a-tablet-better-than-a-laptop"><a href="#Is-a-tablet-better-than-a-laptop" class="headerlink" title="Is a tablet better than a laptop?"></a>Is a tablet better than a laptop?</h2><p>That depends on what you want to use your tablet or laptop for. Digital artists tend to prefer tablets since they’re easier to draw on with a stylus. Tablets are also great for photo editing and streaming movies if you get one with a large enough screen size. But if you want to do things like create spreadsheets, type in a word processing program, or do intensive 3D animation or modeling, you’re better off with a laptop.</p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-tablet-for-students"><a href="#What-is-the-best-tablet-for-students" class="headerlink" title="What is the best tablet for students?"></a>What is the best tablet for students?</h2><p>Our top pick for the best tablet for students is the 10th-generation iPad, thanks to its affordable price and versatility of use.

runs on these servers to verify this privacy promise.

The Nomad Sport Case is our pick for the best iPhone 16 case overall to help sheath your new phone.</p><p>ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner is a big fan of the Nomad brand. He ranks the Nomad Sport Case as the best phone case for the iPhone 15 Pro, praising it for its sleek design and lightweight feel. “I love how light these cases are. Combined with the noticeably lighter iPhone 15 Pro Max, it feels refreshingly light to hold,” Hiner says. Due to the similarities of the 15th and 16th generation of iPhones, the Nomad Sport Case will serve the iPhone 16 just as well.</p><p>This light case also offers enough drop protection and raised edges to keep the sensitive parts of your phone safe without a rugged or bulky feel. It provides protection with elegance, making it a perfect resting place for the sword – or new iPhone 16 – that is now in your hands. The Nomad Sport case is the perfect mix between lightweight and protective. Nomad also uses ethically-sourced material.</p><p><strong>Nomad Sport Case features:</strong> Comes in four colors | 8 feet of drop protection | MagSafe passthrough</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6GGF2JP?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cad37bf78-eb8c-49c4-99ed-c5bcf0b78358%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>MagSafe and magnetic</li><li>Drop protection</li><li>Kickstand</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Kickstand durability</li><li>Not many color options</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1006793/11832" target="_top" id="1006793">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1006793" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1006793/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Torras-360-degree-OStand"><a href="#Torras-360-degree-OStand" class="headerlink" title="Torras 360-degree OStand"></a>Torras 360-degree OStand</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134490/18498" target="_top" id="2134490">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134490" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134490/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-kickstand-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#Best-kickstand-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="Best kickstand iPhone 16 case"></a>Best kickstand iPhone 16 case</h3><p>Torras cases have always been a ZDNET favorite: Hiner called the Ostand case for the iPhone 15 “the most versatile and innovative of the bunch.” The newest version fit for the iPhone 16 follows in its footsteps. </p><p>ZDNET Reviews Editor Kerry Wan went hands-on with the Torras case for the iPhone 16 and found it to be super convenient for a few reasons, “for something more multifunctional, Torras’ 360-degree OStand case has a MagSafe ring on the back that keeps compatible accessories attached to the iPhone at virtually every angle. You can also pull out and rotate the ring for an optimal, on-the-go viewing experience.”</p><p>Reddit users agree, with one saying, “The overall production and material quality of the cases is excellent. I’ve bought multiple Torras cases and screen protectors with my own money in the past, and they always deliver superb quality.”</p><p><strong>Torras Ostand MagSafe Case features:</strong> 12 feet military drop protection | MagSafe back | 16ft Military drop protection</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/821FFFE5-2E7A-4F66-99F3-77CD413C4771/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cad37bf78-eb8c-49c4-99ed-c5bcf0b78358%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Thin form factor -MagSafe -Made from durable materials</li><li>Scratch-resistant</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Minimal drop protection</li><li>Heftier price</li></ul><h2 id="Pitaka-Ultra-Slim-case"><a href="#Pitaka-Ultra-Slim-case" class="headerlink" title="Pitaka Ultra Slim case"></a>Pitaka Ultra Slim case</h2><h3 id="Best-thin-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#Best-thin-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="Best thin iPhone 16 case"></a>Best thin iPhone 16 case</h3><p>Bulky phone cases are annoying, especially if you prefer the Plus version of iPhones. Many protective cases have this problem, making them hard to grasp and stick in your pocket. A Pitaka Ultra phone case will fix this problem.</p><p>The Pitaka brand boasts thin promises for their cases, and they follow through. ZDNET’s Kerry Wan finds it unique but weighs its pros and cons, “Pitaka is one of the originators of the ultra-thin Aramid Fiber case that you see so many brands remix today. With such cases, you’re trading drop protection in favor of slimness and minimalism, two aspects that should help reduce any discomfort when handling the larger iPhone 16 models.”</p><p>Aramid fibers, which is virtually the same as Kevlar, the fabric used in bulletproof vests and aircraft panels. Therefore, the case is durable, scratch-resistant, and protects from everyday wear and tear. If you are looking to find something protective, unique, and thin for your phone, give Pitaka a go.

This is why the Smartish Gripmunk case is our favorite cheap iPhone 16 case.</p><p>It has all the features of higher-end cases- grips on the sides, MagSafe capabilities, scratch resistance, and around 6 feet of drop protection. </p><p>“One of the more affordable options, with a grippy texture along the sides to prevent your phone from slipping out of your hands. I’d especially recommend the Clearly Black variant to anyone who wants to show off their iPhone 16 color – and you definitely should – without worrying about the case yellowing,” said expert tester Kerry Wan.</p><p><strong>Smartish Gripmunk case features:</strong> 6 ft drop protection | MagSafe | Side grips | Camera, screen, and corner protection</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCG3PFFD?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cad37bf78-eb8c-49c4-99ed-c5bcf0b78358%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Super protective</li><li>45 ft drop protection</li><li>Style options</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Pricier</li></ul><h2 id="Mous-Limitless-6-0"><a href="#Mous-Limitless-6-0" class="headerlink" title="Mous Limitless 6.0"></a>Mous Limitless 6.0</h2><h3 id="Best-protective-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#Best-protective-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="Best protective iPhone 16 case"></a>Best protective iPhone 16 case</h3><p>Nothing is more disappointing than dropping and shattering your brand-new device, especially if you chose not to opt for Apple Care.

Kerry Wan, who tested out the case, says, “Mous’ Limitless 6.0 series is one of the more stylish cases I’ve tested, with plenty of cushioning for drop protection. There’s a generous cut-out for the iPhone 16’s Camera Control and the case is offered in various backplates, including Walnut, Bamboo, Leather, and Carbon Fibre.

To best summarize this case, Reddit users describe the Incase Icon as “awesome” and “sexy.” </p><p>The case retails for $60 and does not feature the standard plastic or silicone build, but rather a woven design. Many people stick to the former, “but if you prefer the FineWoven feel of last year’s iPhone cases, check out the Incase Icon, which comes in a fancy Woolenex finish. The material is lined to be weather-repellant and tear-resistant, but the more impressive part is that it doesn’t add much bulk or weight to the iPhone,” says reviews editor Kerry Wan, who tested the case.</p><p>The Incase Icon has raised edges for screen protection, press-fit buttons, MagSafe capabilities, and 10 feet of drop protection. The case has two material options, plant-based corn leather (which comes in Pebbled Obsidian, Pebbled Cocoa, and Pebbled Oat Milk) and Woolenex woven blend (which comes in Graphite, Navy, Blush Pink, Cosmic Red, and Asphalt). The multitude of color options means the Incase Icon can fit any vibe. </p><p>Incase is a great place to look if you want a simple but stylish case.</p><p><strong>Incase Icon features:</strong> 10 ft of drop protection | MagSafe | Raised edges for screen protection | Color options</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1391923&u=4338022&m=90301&afftrack=techidaily&urllink=https://bellelily.pxf.io/m5azgm" >View now at Moft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Vegan leather is sustainable</li><li>Color options</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Not too much protection</li><li>Pricey for low protection</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148642/16836" target="_top" id="2148642">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148642" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="50"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148642/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Moft-Snap-Case-Movas"><a href="#Moft-Snap-Case-Movas" class="headerlink" title="Moft Snap Case Movas"></a>Moft Snap Case Movas</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137225/26400" target="_top" id="2137225">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137225" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137225/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-vegan-leather-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#Best-vegan-leather-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="Best vegan-leather iPhone 16 case"></a>Best vegan-leather iPhone 16 case</h3><p>Leather is always a stylish option to keep around your phone, but sustainably sourcing it can always be questionable. Moft’s Snap Case Movas is our solution to that problem.</p><p>The vegan leather finish does not have the grain that traditional leather sports, but rather a smoother texture and five color options– Misty Cove, Jet Black, Taupe, Earthen Beige, and Cement. </p><p>ZDNET’s reviews editor Kerry Wan says, “while Apple didn’t replace its FineWoven cases with a vegan leather option this year, Moft’s Snap Case is a worthy alternative. The company’s Snap Phone Tripod Stand is a crowd-favorite among ZDNET editors, and its Snap Case is just as appreciable. The soft-touch finish contrasts well with the hard-brushed buttons, and there’s just enough spacing left for the Camera Control and charging port.” </p><p>Although it is not a protective case, it is a stylish alternative if you prefer leather or woven cases. </p><p><strong>Moft Snap Case Movas features:</strong> Vegan leather | MagSafe | Five color options</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/stores/NOMAD/page/6927BCAB-A05E-40FA-ADA7-1E37C46F23E5?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cad37bf78-eb8c-49c4-99ed-c5bcf0b78358%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9041660-15735858?url=https%253A%252F%252Fnomadgoods.com%252Fproducts%252Fmodern-leather-case-rustic-brown-horween-iphone-16-pro-max&sid=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp" >View now at Nomad Goods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Worn-in leather material</li><li>MagSafe capabilities</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Unsure on sustainability</li><li>Only for Pro models</li></ul><h2 id="Nomad-Modern-Leather-Case"><a href="#Nomad-Modern-Leather-Case" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Modern Leather Case"></a>Nomad Modern Leather Case</h2><h3 id="Best-leather-case-for-iPhone-16"><a href="#Best-leather-case-for-iPhone-16" class="headerlink" title="Best leather case for iPhone 16"></a>Best leather case for iPhone 16</h3><p>Leather is always a stylish and sleek choice for a phone case. However, it is not always the best at lasting or, sometimes, gripping your phone. That is why the Nomad Modern Leather case is a standout in this category. Even though leather is not the most sustainable material, Nomad asserts it sources it in sustainable ways.</p><p>ZDNET’s Hiner places the Nomad Leather case on his list of the best cases for iPhone 15 Pro. He writes, “With Apple’s leather cases, it would take weeks or months to absorb hand oils and become softer and easier to grip… With Nomad’s leather, you don’t have to do that. It’s soft and feels great in your hands as soon as you take it out of the box. If leather is still your thing, it’s a better leather case than the ones Apple used to sell.”</p><p>That being said, leather is not everybody’s thing. But, if you are in the market for a leather case with a MagSafe back, possibly sustainably sourced material, a camera protection, the Nomad Modern Leather case may be your winner.</p><p><strong>Nomad Modern Leather case features:</strong> 8 feet drop protection | Sustainably sourced leather | MagSafe and magnetic back</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#What-is-the-best-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="What is the best iPhone 16 case?"></a>What is the best iPhone 16 case?</h2><p>Our pick for the best iPhone 16 case is the Nomad Sport case for its sleek design and solid protection.

The most relevant aspects are:</p><ul><li><strong>Drop</strong> <strong>Protection:</strong> The hard truth is that all humans are accident-prone. If you are anything like me, dropping your phone is more than a daily occurrence. When picking a phone case, it is wise to consider how often you drop your phone.</li><li><strong>Style:</strong> iPhone cases go beyond just protecting the device. Like most people, you may want a phone case that matches your personal style and is pleasing to the eye.</li><li><strong>Cost:</strong> iPhones are expensive, and spending a lot on a phone case just adds to the bill. Therefore, we consider price an important factor in our selections.</li><li><strong>Special Features:</strong> Many cases have added features like MagSafe capabilities and a kickstand. We include these products to appease those who may prefer wireless charging or other necessary features.</li></ul><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-iPhone-16-cases"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-iPhone-16-cases" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these iPhone 16 cases?"></a>How did we choose these iPhone 16 cases?</h2><p>To choose these iPhone 16 cases, we performed extensive research over every corner of the internet, like Reddit forums and customer reviews, to find the best picks at the time of this writing.

We suggest filtering the posts based on flair so that you can focus on one aspect of OpenAI at a time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868499/19272" target="_top" id="1868499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868499/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-r-StableDiffusion"><a href="#8-r-StableDiffusion" class="headerlink" title="8.r&#x2F;StableDiffusion"></a>8.<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/" >r&#x2F;StableDiffusion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stablediffusion-prompts-on-reddit.jpg"                      alt="Reddit Community for Stable Diffusion Prompts and Output"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049364/7443" target="_top" id="2049364">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049364" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049364/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> r&#x2F;StableDiffusion is the largest subreddit dedicated to Stable Diffusion. The community allows sharing workflows. However, it primarily encourages users to post outputs and discuss relevant AI news—prompt engineering is merely a part of generating AI art.</p><p> The group might be helpful if you prefer Stable Diffusion over Midjourney and Dall-E models. Study the system’s limits and capabilities. Users post various media forms, including 3D images, 2D portraits, and animations.</p><p> Meanwhile, artists who prefer other text-to-image models could use the group for comparisons. See which system provides the best outputs. You might even find Stable Diffusion users testing your preferred art styles frequently.</p><h2 id="9-Sales-Marketing-Social-Media-Artificial-Intelligence-AI-ChatGPT-Technology-Innovation-Network"><a href="#9-Sales-Marketing-Social-Media-Artificial-Intelligence-AI-ChatGPT-Technology-Innovation-Network" class="headerlink" title="9.Sales, Marketing, Social Media, Artificial Intelligence (AI), ChatGPT Technology Innovation Network"></a>9.<a class="link"   href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/54066/" >Sales, Marketing, Social Media, Artificial Intelligence (AI), ChatGPT Technology Innovation Network <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/linkedin-ai-group.jpg"                      alt="LinkedIn Group to Share AI Tips for Salespeople and Marketers"                ></p><p> It’s currently the largest AI community on LinkedIn. The group has around a million members worldwide, many of whom post regularly. It gets status updates every few minutes.</p><p> As its name suggests, the community focuses on the applications of AI in sales, marketing, and social media ads. Most just share prompts. But you’ll also find engaging discussions about<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tasks-freelancers-should-automate/" >automating work tasks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , like lead generation, appointment setting, and client management.</p><p> The admins are relatively active. Every few weeks, they upload relevant resources, like websites, PDFs, and tools. You can also connect with them for queries. Just don’t expect an immediate response unless you already have mutuals.</p><p> Perhaps the only downside is the group gets plenty of spam. You might have to scroll through aggressive ads and campaigns before finding valuable content.</p><h2 id="Connect-With-Fellow-Professionals-in-the-AI-Industry"><a href="#Connect-With-Fellow-Professionals-in-the-AI-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Connect With Fellow Professionals in the AI Industry"></a>Connect With Fellow Professionals in the AI Industry</h2><p> AI is constantly evolving. No individual can keep up with every AI-driven platform, model, or method that global tech leaders release. You’d do well to join communities instead. Connect with like-minded professionals, discuss AI’s real-life applications, and gain reliable insights into new systems. You can only test so many tools yourself, after all.</p><p> If you enjoy working with AI systems and models, build a career in them. Choose roles that suit your skill set. For instance, experienced coders can look into programming and developing, while communication graduates might thrive as prompt engineers.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-blueprints-for-success-top-10-insights-into-instagram-video-marketing/"><u>[New] In 2024, Blueprints for Success Top 10 Insights Into Instagram Video Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-professional-looking-gopro-videos-without-shakiness/"><u>[New] Professional-Looking GoPro Videos without Shakiness</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-platforms-for-futuristic-font-designs/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Best Platforms for Futuristic Font Designs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/german-a-challenge-worth-taking/"><u>German: A Challenge Worth Taking?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-retrieve-erased-videos-from-lava-blaze-2-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-video/"><u>How to retrieve erased videos from Lava Blaze 2 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-top-online-tools-for-perfecting-your-video-subtitles/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Top Online Tools for Perfecting Your Video Subtitles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/navigating-content-creation-with-chatgpt-4-critical-errors-to-dodge-for-optimal-results/"><u>Navigating Content Creation with ChatGPT: 4 Critical Errors to Dodge for Optimal Results</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/navigating-local-language-models-advantages-and-disadvantages-explained/"><u>Navigating Local Language Models: Advantages & Disadvantages Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/nosubscriptionslots-eagerly-waiting-new-access/"><u>NoSubscriptionSlots: Eagerly Waiting New Access</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/pro-level-iphone-photo-tips-and-tricks-for-2024/"><u>Pro-Level iPhone Photo Tips and Tricks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/siri-vs-chatgpt-understand-what-sets-them-apart/"><u>Siri Vs.

However, crafting the perfect AI prompt for every situation is more difficult than it sounds, which is where AI prompt marketplaces come in.</p><p> If you’re looking to buy AI prompts or even sell some prompts of your own, you may find AI prompt marketplaces useful—but which is the best AI prompt platform?</p><h2 id="1-PromptBase"><a href="#1-PromptBase" class="headerlink" title="1.PromptBase"></a>1.<a class="link"   href="https://promptbase.com/" >PromptBase <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/prompt-base-1.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of promptbase website homepage"                ></p><p> PromptBase offers over 100,000 AI prompts for various popular models, including MidJourney, DALL-E, ChatGPT, and Stable Diffusion. This doesn’t stop at text prompts alone. PromptBase has logo and icon prompts, art prompts, gaming prompts, and photography prompts for all the creatives out there.</p><p> But if you’re looking for simpler prompts, PromptBase has your back. Maybe you’re looking for prompts to boost your productivity, aid you in coding, or help you as a business owner. PromptBase provides prompts for all these areas across numerous models.</p><p> To find the AI prompt you need, use PromptBase’s search input tool or browse through the categories in the top bar menu on the website’s homepage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/prompt-base-2.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of promptbase search results"                ></p><p> Even when searching via category, you can filter your searches to narrow down the options based on your preferences.</p><p> On top of this, PromptBase gives users the chance to sell their own prompts and hire individuals to create prompts. PromptBase has a wide range of prompt engineers to choose from, and you can view engineers based on the AI model they can develop prompts for. After clicking on the engineer’s profile, you can see which prompts they currently have for sale, though you can message them if you’re looking for something bespoke and specific.</p><p> You can pay for prompts on PromptBase via the Stripe<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/payment-providers-for-react-paypal-stripe-square/" >online payment processor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> To sell a prompt, PromptBase requires you to provide a prompt name, type, description, and price. Then, you’ll need to directly paste your prompt into the provided box. PromptBase will test the prompt to see if it’s legitimate, and if everything checks out, you can go ahead and list your prompt.</p><h2 id="2-PromptHero"><a href="#2-PromptHero" class="headerlink" title="2.PromptHero"></a>2.<a class="link"   href="https://prompthero.com/" >PromptHero <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/prompt-hero-1.jpg"                      alt="prompthero website homepage screenshot"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885928/19272" target="_top" id="1885928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> PromptHero offers a fairly similar service to PromptBase. This prompt marketplace offers prompts for ChatGPT, Midjourney, Openjourney, and Stable Diffusion. These prompts can be used for all kinds of purposes, including photography, anime, architecture, fashion, interior design, logos, and icons. If you want a general browse, you can also take a look at PromptHero’s Featured, Hot, New, and Top categories.</p><p> PromptHero allows you to browse categories via the top menu bar, though you can also use the website’s search engine for more specific results.</p><p> PromptHero offers a premium version of its marketplace for $9 monthly. Without this premium subscription, you’ll only be able to use 25 free prompt credits per month. With the subscription, your monthly prompt cap will be increased to 300.</p><p> A particularly interesting feature offered by Prompt Hero is its Jobs section. This page lets you search for AI jobs, whether remote or in-house, which is great for those with skills in AI. You can use PromptHero to access the application portal for the job you desire, and you can also view the salary, contract term, or hourly rate.</p><h2 id="3-ChatX"><a href="#3-ChatX" class="headerlink" title="3.ChatX"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://chatx.ai/" >ChatX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/chat-x-website.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of chatx website homepage"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082520/7443" target="_top" id="2082520">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082520" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082520/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> ChatX offers free and paid prompts for ChatGPT, Midjourney, and DALL-E 2. When you arrive at the homepage of ChatX, you’ve got two options. You can head to the general prompt marketplace or ChatX’s prompt generator. If you want to find preexisting prompts, head to the general prompt marketplace. If you want a specific prompt created on your behalf, head to the prompt generator.</p><p> On ChatX’s prompt marketplace, you can find prompts for ChatGPT, DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. What’s great is that many of ChatX’s prompts are entirely free. You can find free image prompts, professional prompts, meal plan prompts, marketing prompts, art prompts, and more using this platform, so there’s something for everyone. By either using the ChatX search bar or AI model categories, you can find the right prompt for you.</p><p> On the other hand, if you opt for ChatX’s ChatGPT or Midjourney prompt generator, you can have text-based prompts created on your behalf for free.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/chat-x-generator.jpg"                      alt="chat x chatgpt prompt generator screenshot"                ></p><p> Simply describe what you want the AI model to act as and produce, and you’ll be provided with a text prompt to download for future use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137211/26400" target="_top" id="2137211">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137211" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137211/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-PromptSea"><a href="#4-PromptSea" class="headerlink" title="4.PromptSea"></a>4.<a class="link"   href="https://www.promptsea.io/" >PromptSea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/prompt-sea-site.jpg"                      alt="promptsea website homepage screenshot"                ></p><p> PromptSea isn’t just an AI prompt marketplace but can certainly be used to find useful AI prompts. When you head to the PromptSea website, you won’t be instantly met with the prompt marketplace. However, if you scroll down a little, you’ll see a small number of featured AI prompts displayed. Click on the<strong>Prompts</strong> title, and you’ll be taken to PromptSea’s prompts platform. Here, you can find image prompts for ChatGPT, Midjourney, DALLE-2, Novel AI, Nightcafe, Jasper, and Niji Journey.</p><p> It’s important to note that PromptSea has an interesting twist: each prompt is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft/" >non-fungible token (NFT) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

But did you know Etsy also sells some useful AI prompts?</p><p> Typing “AI prompts” in Etsy’s search bar reveals the range of AI prompts for sale on the platform. You can find prompts for Midjourney, ChatGPT, DALL-E, and other AI models on Etsy, though these very often come in bundles. On the other prompt marketplaces discussed here, you can buy or generate a single prompt, but Etsy sellers sell prompts in packs of hundreds or even thousands.</p><p>So, how do you know what you’re buying?</p><p> When you see a prompt bundle you’re interested in on Etsy, click on the listing and read the item details. This is crucial to determine what kind of prompts you’re purchasing here. The title will likely indicate the type or theme of the prompts included, but you can usually access more information in the item details section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/etsy-item-page-1.jpg"                      alt="highlighted item details section on etsy product page"                ></p><p> If you want to buy just a handful of AI prompts or something highly specific, Etsy may not be the right platform. Don’t forget that Etsy isn’t a dedicated AI prompt marketplace designed for finding and searching for prompts specifically.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136612/26400" target="_top" id="2136612">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136612" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136612/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-AIPRM"><a href="#6-AIPRM" class="headerlink" title="6.AIPRM"></a>6.<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aiprm-for-chatgpt/ojnbohmppadfgpejeebfnmnknjdlckgj" >AIPRM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/chatgpt-aiprgm-plugin.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt interface with aiprm plugin active"                ></p><p> AIPRM isn’t a website-based marketplace. Rather, it is a free Chrome extension that lets you access useful ChatGPT prompts while using the ChatGPT interface.</p><p> After installing the AIPRM plugin, connect your AIPRM account to your ChatGPT account. This lets AIPRM operate while you use ChatGPT. Once you’ve got this sorted, you can get started with AIPRM.</p><p> While using AIPRM on ChatGPT, you’ll notice that the normal chat page now has much more content. You’ll see a myriad of suggested pitches and some search filters you can use to find the right prompt for you. You can filter prompts by topic, activity, GPT model, author name, prompt hint, and other factors. Alternatively, you can search for a prompt in the search bar on the right-hand side of the page.</p><p> There are a few premium versions of AIPRM available, which lets you save your favorite prompts, hide prompts, create custom prompt lists, and much more. The extra features on offer depend on the kind of premium plan you go for. Currently, AIPRM offers the following premium tiers:</p><ul><li><strong>Plus:</strong> $5&#x2F;month</li><li><strong>Pro:</strong> $20&#x2F;month</li><li><strong>Elite:</strong> $50&#x2F;month</li><li><strong>Titan:</strong> $500&#x2F;month</li></ul><p> Check out<a class="link"   href="https://www.aiprm.com/blog/introducing-aiprm-premium-for-chatgpt/" >AIPRM’s plan information page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to see what each tier offers.</p><h2 id="7-FlowGPT"><a href="#7-FlowGPT" class="headerlink" title="7.FlowGPT"></a>7.<a class="link"   href="https://flowgpt.com/" >FlowGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/flow-gpt-site.jpg"                      alt="screennshot of flowgpt website homepage"                ></p><p> FlowGPT offers a range of useful AI services, including a prompt marketplace for ChatGPT users. FlowGPT’s marketplace works a little differently from your standard prompt marketplace, with the option to actually interact with a wide range of AI chatbots using GPT.</p><p> You can ask your chosen GPT-based bot to produce a prompt for you, though it’s important to remember that specific bots are designed for specific kinds of prompts. For instance, if you want a job-hunting prompt, head to FlowGPT’s job-hunting section.</p><p> You can also create prompts on FlowGPT if you want to list your prompts for other users to access.</p><h2 id="Prompt-Marketplaces-Can-Transform-Your-AI-Chabot-Experience"><a href="#Prompt-Marketplaces-Can-Transform-Your-AI-Chabot-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Prompt Marketplaces Can Transform Your AI Chabot Experience"></a>Prompt Marketplaces Can Transform Your AI Chabot Experience</h2><p> AI chatbots are incredibly useful tools, but having the right AI prompts to hand can help you get the best possible responses from your chosen generative AI tool.

Thankfully, carriers tend to launch frequent promotions on all of Apple’s iPhone models. That means you’re not locked into getting whatever the newest (and most expensive) iPhone is. But if the latest iPhone 15 is what you’re after, we’ve found the best deals available.</p><p>If you know where to look, you can also find deals on models including the iPhone SE, iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, and the iPhone 14, both carrier-locked and unlocked. You’ll notice that many carrier deals have the potential to net you a free iPhone, including the latest models. Naturally, the devil’s in the details (the fine print) for any smartphone deal.

Having tried many, I’ve always come away feeling that most are poorly made or just inconvenient to use. Also, as summer approaches and temperatures rise, I know that charging my iPhone on a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-wireless-charger/" >wireless charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is going to become a hit or miss.  </p><p>Given how good I’ve found ESR charging devices to be, I decided to give the <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/ESR-HaloLock-CryoBoost-Compatible-Phone-Cooling/dp/B09Y5QX2CD/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cf4af1997-d498-42d6-a0f9-897c739bdfeb%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >HaloLock 3-in-1 for MagSafe Charging Station with CryoBoost <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> a try.

I’ve tested this previously on <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/is-this-the-ultimate-wireless-car-charger-my-iphone-tells-me-yes/" >ESR’s in-car iPhone charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it works really well. If the iPhone isn’t going to fall off inside a truck bouncing across rough roads, it’s not going to fall off on your nightstand. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The other word is “CryoBoost”. There’s a fan built into the wireless charging head to keep it cool in use. Again, this is <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/is-this-the-ultimate-wireless-car-charger-my-iphone-tells-me-yes/" >the same charging head that I tested in my truck in the hot sun <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it did an amazing job of keeping my iPhone cool while charging. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/is-this-the-ultimate-wireless-car-charger-my-iphone-tells-me-yes/" >Is this the ultimate wireless car charger? My iPhone tells me yes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I appreciate that this kit comes with a charger. Quite a few of the others I’ve tried require you to buy your own, which isn’t a huge problem. But having everything you need in the box is a nice touch and prevents confusion on the owner’s part. </p><p>Charger included.</p><p>Adrian Kingsley-Hughes&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Before you can charge your Apple Watch you will need to find your Apple Watch charger, as you’ll need to attach this to the charging station. </p><p>Now, previous ones I’ve tested have needed a USB-A version of the Apple Watch charger. I spent a good half hour looking for one before realizing that this charging station can accommodate both USB-A and USB-C flavors of the Apple Watch charging cable. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-keeps-selling-out-of-this-3-in-1-charging-cube-i-tested-one-to-see-if-its-worth-the-wait/"><strong>Apple keeps selling out of this 3-in-1 charging cube. I tested one to see if it’s worth the wait</strong></a> </p><p>To fit the Apple Watch charging cable, you need to unclip the base and thread the charging cable into the slot cut in the base. And I have to say, I’m impressed by the precision of this slot. </p><p>I mean, take a look at it. </p><p>The precision of the slot of the Apple Watch charging cable is impressive.</p><p>Adrian Kingsley-Hughes&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Another feature that I appreciate is the sleep mode feature. Too many nightstand charging stations are a Christmas tree of eye-piercing LED lights. A single button on this charging station turns off the LEDs and the fan, ensuring that you have a good night’s sleep. </p><p>As I said earlier, I’ve been using this charging station for several weeks now, and I’ve had no problem at all. The charger unit is sturdy and made very well, the magnets do a fine job of holding the iPhone and AirPods Pro in place, and the unit charges everything just as you’d expect. Oh, and night mode means you don’t have to try to sleep next to a pile of glowing LEDs. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-accessory/"><strong>The best

Similarly, a remote monitoring app promoted for parental use or work purposes could be abused to become a privacy invader rather than a legitimate service. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-microsoft-recall-a-privacy-nightmare-7-reasons-you-can-stop-worrying-about-it/" >Is Microsoft Recall a ‘privacy nightmare’? 7 reasons not to worry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Whatever the form, mobile spyware may steal your information, track your location, record your conversations, and more. Our guide will run through different forms of malicious software that could end up on your iOS or Android handset, the warning signs of infection, and how to remove such pestilence from your smartphone whenever it is possible to do so. We will also discuss stalkerware and other ways threats closer to home may spy on you – and what you can do about it.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-spyware"><a href="#What-is-spyware" class="headerlink" title="What is spyware?"></a>What is spyware?</h2><p>Spyware comes in many forms, and it’s useful to know the basic differences before you tackle the problem. </p><p><strong>Nuisanceware</strong> is often bundled with legitimate apps. It interrupts your web browsing with pop-ups, changes your homepage or search engine settings, and may also gather your browsing data to sell it to advertising agencies and networks. </p><p>Although considered <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/malvertising-campaign-strikes-top-websites-worldwide/" >malvertising <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, nuisanceware is generally not dangerous or a threat to your core security. Instead, these malware packages are focused on illicit revenue generation by infecting machines and creating forced ad views or clicks.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-password-manager/"><strong>The best password managers you can buy</strong></a></p><p>There’s also standard mobile <strong>spyware</strong>. These generic forms of malware steal operating system and clipboard data and anything of potential value, such as cryptocurrency wallet data or account credentials. Spyware isn’t always targeted and may be used in general <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-phishing-how-to-protect-yourself-from-scam-emails-and-more/" >phishing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> attacks. </p><p>Spyware may land on your device through phishing, malicious email attachments, social media links, or fraudulent SMS messages.</p><p><strong>Advanced spyware</strong>, sometimes also classified as <strong>stalkerware</strong>, is a step up from basic spyware. Unethical and sometimes dangerous, this malware is sometimes found on desktop systems, but it is now more commonly implanted on phones. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-out-if-an-airtag-is-tracking-you/" >How to find out if an AirTag is tracking you <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Spyware and stalkerware may be used for the following purposes:</p><ul><li>To monitor emails, SMS, MMS messages, and other forms of communication sent and received</li><li>To intercept live calls to eavesdrop across standard telephone lines or Voice over IP (VoIP) applications</li><li>To record environmental noise</li><li>To hijack camera functions to take photos and videos</li><li>To screenshot mobile device activities and send them to a controller</li><li>To track victims via GPS</li><li>To hijack social media apps such as Facebook and WhatsApp</li><li>For keylogging, account compromise, and data theft</li></ul><p>Stalkerware is typically used to spy on someone as an individual and watch what they do, say, and where they go. Stalkerware is commonly linked to cases of <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-todays-technologies-become-weapons-in-modern-domestic-abuse/" >domestic abuse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>Finally, there’s <strong>government-grade commercial spyware</strong>. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-used-against-journalists-political-activists-worldwide-report/" >Pegasus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the most well-known variants, sold to governments as a tool for combating terrorism and for law enforcement purposes. Pegasus was ultimately found on smartphones belonging to journalists, activists, political dissidents, and lawyers. Unless you’re part of a group of specific interest to ethically challenged governments, it’s unlikely that commercial-grade spyware will impact you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137202/26400" target="_top" id="2137202">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137202" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137202/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-the-warning-signs-of-a-spyware-infection-attempt"><a href="#What-are-the-warning-signs-of-a-spyware-infection-attempt" class="headerlink" title="What are the warning signs of a spyware infection attempt?"></a>What are the warning signs of a spyware infection attempt?</h2><p>There are several signs to watch for that might indicate you are being targeted by a spyware or stalkerware operator. </p><p>Finding yourself the recipient of odd or unusual social media messages or emails might be part of a spyware infection attempt. You should delete these without clicking on any links or downloading any files. </p><p>The same is true for SMS messages, which may contain links to trick you into unwittingly downloading malware. For example, you could receive an SMS failed delivery notice or payment ‘request’ masked to appear from a well-known service.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ransomware-everything-you-need-to-know-and-how-to-reduce-your-risk/"><strong>What is ransomware? Everything you need to know and how to reduce your risk</strong></a></p><p>To catch a victim unaware, phishing messages will lure you into clicking a link or executing software that hosts a spyware or stalkerware payload. If the malware is being loaded remotely, user interaction is required, and so these messages might try to panic you – for example, by demanding payment to a tax office or bank, or by posing as a failed delivery notice. Messages could potentially use spoofed addresses from a contact you trust, too.</p><p>When it comes to stalkerware, initial infection messages may be more personal and tailored to the victim. Physical access or the victim’s accidental installation of spyware is necessary. However, installing some variants of stalkerware can take mere moments.</p><p>If your phone goes missing or has been out of your possession for a time, and reappears with different settings or changes that you do not recognize, this may be an indicator that your device has been tampered with.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-typical-signs-that-spyware-is-on-my-phone"><a href="#What-are-the-typical-signs-that-spyware-is-on-my-phone" class="headerlink" title="What are the typical signs that spyware is on my phone?"></a>What are the typical signs that spyware is on my phone?</h2><p>Depending on the type of mobile malware at hand, there are signs you can watch out for that may indicate your smartphone has been compromised. </p><p>You may experience unexpected handset battery drain, overheating, and strange behavior from your handset’s operating system or apps. Settings such as GPS and location functions may turn on and off unexpectedly, or you may experience random reboots and unexplained crashes. </p><p>If you suddenly are using far more cellular data than normal, this could also indicate that information is being sent from your smartphone without your knowledge or that remote connections are active. In addition, another symptom could be that you are hearing unusual noises or distortion during phone calls, and although this could simply be down to poor reception, it may also be a sign of interception.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/" >The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>You may also have trouble turning off your device completely.</p><p>Certain forms of spyware focused on fraudulent revenue generation may be able to secure enough permissions to impact your bank balance. If you are signed up for services or premium SMS plans and you know you didn’t consent to them, this could be a sign that spyware is on your device. </p><p>Keep an eye on your credit cards for any signs of suspicious payments. </p><p>An important point to mention is that sometimes spyware or other forms of malicious software might end up on your device via an originally benign app. There have been cases of developers releasing a genuine, useful app in official repositories, such as a currency converter or weather app, and then – after a large user base has been gathered – the developers twist the app’s functions through a software update. </p><p>Previously, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/android-warning-these-malicious-apps-had-over-a-million-downloads-from-google-play/" >Google removed malicious apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the Google Play Store that had been masquerading as Bluetooth utilities. These apps had been downloaded by over a million users and while the apps didn’t appear malicious at first, within days, users were bombarded with ads and pop-ups.</p><p>Unfortunately, there’s little that the average user can do if an app is updated with data stealing and other malicious functions. However, if you recently downloaded a mobile app and now your phone is displaying odd behavior, consider removing them and running a malware scan.</p><h2 id="What-other-signs-might-I-see-on-Android-and-iOS-devices"><a href="#What-other-signs-might-I-see-on-Android-and-iOS-devices" class="headerlink" title="What other signs might I see on Android and iOS devices?"></a>What other signs might I see on Android and iOS devices?</h2><p>Surveillance software is becoming more sophisticated and can be difficult to detect. However, not all forms of spyware and stalkerware are invisible, and it is possible, in many cases, to find out if you are being monitored.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036467/19272" target="_top" id="2036467">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036467" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036467/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Android"><a href="#Android" class="headerlink" title="Android"></a>Android</h3><p>One telltale sign on an Android device is a setting that allows apps to be downloaded and installed outside of the official Google Play Store. </p><p>If this setting is enabled, this may indicate tampering and jailbreaking without your consent. Not every form of spyware and stalkerware requires a jailbroken device, though.</p><p>This setting is found in most modern Android builds in <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Allow unknown sources</strong>. (This varies depending on the device and vendor.) You can also check <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Menu</strong> &gt; <strong>Special Access</strong> &gt; <strong>Install unknown apps</strong> to see if anything appears that you do not recognize, but there is no guarantee that spyware will show up on the app list.</p><p>Some forms of spyware will also use generic names and icons to avoid detection. For example, they may appear to be useful utility apps such as calendars, calculators, utilities, or currency converters. If a process or app comes up on the app list that you are not familiar with, a quick search online may help you find out whether it is legitimate.</p><h3 id="iOS"><a href="#iOS" class="headerlink" title="iOS"></a>iOS</h3><p>iOS devices that aren’t jailbroken are generally harder to install malware on than Android handsets unless a spyware developer is exploiting for a zero-day or unpatched vulnerability. However, the same principles apply: with the right tool, exploit, or software, your device could be compromised either with physical access or remotely. You may be more susceptible to infection if you have not updated your iPhone’s firmware to the latest version and you do not run frequent antivirus scans.</p><p>Both iOS and Android phones, however, will typically show some sign of a malware infection.</p><h2 id="How-can-I-remove-spyware-from-my-device"><a href="#How-can-I-remove-spyware-from-my-device" class="headerlink" title="How can I remove spyware from my device?"></a>How can I remove spyware from my device?</h2><p>By design, spyware and stalkerware are hard to detect and can be just as hard to remove. It is not impossible in <em>most</em> cases, but it may take some drastic steps on your part. Sometimes the last-resort option may be to abandon your device. </p><p>When spyware is removed, especially in the case of stalkerware, some attackers will receive an alert warning them that the victim’s device has been cleaned up. Should the flow of your information suddenly stop, this would be another clear sign to the attacker that the malicious software has been removed. </p><p>Do not tamper with your device if you feel your physical safety may be in danger. Instead, reach out to the police and supporting agencies.</p><p>Now, here are some removal options:</p><ul><li><strong>Run a malware scan:</strong> There are mobile antivirus solutions available that can detect and remove spyware. This is the easiest solution available, but it may not be effective in every case. Cybersecurity vendors, including <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.malwarebytes.antimalware&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >Malwarebytes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.avast.com/free-mobile-security" >Avast <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitdefender.security&hl=en_GB&gl=US" >Bitdefender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, all offer mobile spyware-scanning tools. This is the easiest option for run-of-the-mill infections.</li><li><strong>Use a dedicated spyware removal tool</strong>: You can also try using software specifically designed to detect and remove spyware. However, be careful to download tools provided only by reputable firms and through official sources, as one of the most common ways to package malware is by disguising it as antivirus software.</li><li><strong>Delete suspicious apps</strong>: Examine the list of apps installed on your handset and remove any apps you don’t recognize.</li><li><strong>Check device administration</strong>: Found within advanced security settings, you can check to see if any suspicious apps have administration permission levels. If so, you can try to remove it, although this could mean you need to restore your handset to factory settings.</li><li><strong>Reboot in Safe mode</strong>: Restarting your smartphone in Safe mode will prevent third-party software from operating. On Android handsets, you can usually do this by long-pressing the power off button and selecting Safe mode. This can allow you to safely uninstall apps – but it is not a failsafe solution regarding advanced spyware variants.</li><li><strong>Update your operating system:</strong> It may seem obvious, but when an operating system releases a new version, which often comes with security patches and upgrades, it can – if you’re lucky – cause conflict and problems with spyware. Keep this updated.</li><li><strong>If all else fails, factory reset… or junk it:</strong> Performing a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-prepare-your-phone-to-trade-in/" >factory reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and clean install on the device you believe is compromised may help eradicate some forms of spyware and stalkerware. However, make sure to back up important content first. On <strong>Android</strong> platforms, the reset option is usually found under <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General Management</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory Data Reset</strong>. On <strong>iOS</strong>, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Transfer or</strong> <strong>Reset phone</strong>.</li></ul><p>Google’s guide to factory resetting your device can be found <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/6088915?hl=en-GB" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and Apple has also <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph7a2a9399b/ios" >provided instructions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on its support website.</p><p>Unfortunately, some stalkerware services may survive factory resets. So, failing all of that, consider restoring to factory levels and then throwing your device away.</p><p>If you have found suspicious software on your handset, consider the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Change your passwords:</strong> If you suspect account compromise, change the passwords of every important account you have. Many of us have one or two central “hub” accounts, such as an email address linked to all of our other services. Remove access to any such hub services you use from a compromised device. For added security, consider changing your account passwords on a PC and forcing a logout on other devices.</li><li><strong>Creating a new email address:</strong> Known only to you, the new email becomes tethered to your main accounts. If stalkerware is involved, this should be an option you consider if it is safe. It can help you wrestle back control of your accounts in a discreet and quiet way without alerting anyone.</li></ul><h2 id="What-can-I-do-about-about-advanced-commercial-spyware"><a href="#What-can-I-do-about-about-advanced-commercial-spyware" class="headerlink" title="What can I do about about advanced, commercial spyware?"></a>What can I do about about advanced, commercial spyware?</h2><p>Government-grade spyware can be more difficult to detect. However, as noted in a <a class="link"   href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/how-to-protect-from-pegasus-spyware/43453/" >guide on Pegasus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and other forms of commercial-grade malware published by Kaspersky, there are some actions you can take to mitigate the risk of being subject to such surveillance, based on current research and findings:</p><ul><li><strong>Reboots:</strong> Reboot your device daily to prevent persistence from taking hold. The majority of infections have appeared to be based on zero-day exploits with little persistence; therefore, rebooting can hamper attackers.</li><li><strong>Disable iMessage and FaceTime (iOS):</strong> As features enabled by default, iMessage and FaceTime are attractive avenues for exploitation. A number of new Safari and iMessage exploits have been developed in recent years.</li><li><strong>Use an alternative browser other than Safari or default Chrome:</strong> Some exploits do not work well on alternatives such as Firefox Focus or the Tor Browser.</li><li><strong>Use a</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"><strong>trusted, paid VPN service</strong></a> <strong>and install an app that warns when your device has been jailbroken. Some AV apps will also</strong> perform this check.</li><li><strong>GrapheneOS</strong>: It is also recommended that individuals who suspect a Pegasus infection make use of a secondary device, preferably running the Android-based <a class="link"   href="https://grapheneos.org/" >GrapheneOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, for secure communication.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139557/4704" target="_top" id="2139557">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139557" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139557/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-do-I-keep-spyware-and-stalkerware-off-my-device-in-the-first-place"><a href="#How-do-I-keep-spyware-and-stalkerware-off-my-device-in-the-first-place" class="headerlink" title="How do I keep spyware and stalkerware off my device in the first place?"></a>How do I keep spyware and stalkerware off my device in the first place?</h2><p>Unfortunately, no mobile device is completely protected against the scourge of spyware. However, we have provided some tips below to mitigate the risk of future infections:</p><ul><li><strong>Protect your device physically</strong>: Your first line of defense is to maintain adequate physical controls. Modern smartphones allow you to set PIN codes and patterns or use biometrics, including fingerprints or retina scans, to prevent your handset from being physically tampered with.</li><li><strong>Update your operating system:</strong> When system updates are available, ensure you install them in a timely fashion. They contain security fixes and patches and are one of the most important defenses against malware.</li><li><strong>Use antivirus software:</strong> Mobile antivirus solutions can detect and remove spyware. Running frequent scans will help protect your handset.</li><li><strong>Only download apps from official sources</strong>: The majority of spyware and malware is found outside of Google Play and Apple’s App Store, so be cautious about installing apps from third-party websites.</li><li><strong>Enable app security</strong>: Enable inbuilt scanners that check any new app installs. On Android, you can find this setting in Security and privacy &gt; App security.</li><li><strong>Check permissions</strong>: You should monitor what permissions have been issued to what apps, and when. On Android, this can be found in Security and privacy &gt; Permission manager. If you haven’t used an app for a while that has extensive permissions, consider deleting it. If any apps appear to be more intrusive than they need to be, remove them.</li><li><strong>Watch out for malicious links</strong>: Mobile malware is often spread through phishing and malicious links, which are spread through platforms including social media services. These links may urge you to download apps from outside of Google Play or the App Store and may be disguised as everything from antivirus software to streaming services.</li><li><strong>Do not jailbreak your device</strong>: Jailbreaking not only voids your warranty but can also allow malicious apps and software to have a deep foothold in your operating system, which may make removal extremely difficult or impossible.</li><li><strong>Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):</strong> When account activity and logins require further consent from a mobile device, this can also help protect individual accounts. (However, spyware may intercept the codes sent during <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/better-than-the-best-password-how-to-use-2fa-to-improve-your-security/" >2FA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> protocols.)</li></ul><h2 id="What-are-Google-and-Apple-doing-to-protect-Android-and-iOS-devices"><a href="#What-are-Google-and-Apple-doing-to-protect-Android-and-iOS-devices" class="headerlink" title="What are Google and Apple doing to protect Android and iOS devices?"></a>What are Google and Apple doing to protect Android and iOS devices?</h2><p>Google and Apple are generally quick to tackle malicious apps that manage to avoid the privacy and security protections imposed in their respective official app stores. </p><p>In 2019, Google <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-cleans-out-stalker-apps-from-play-store/" >removed seven apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the Play Store that were marketed as employee and child trackers. The tech giant took a dim view of their overreaching functions – including GPS device tracking, access to SMS messages, theft of contact lists, and potentially the exposure of communication taking place in messaging applications. </p><p>Since then, Google has banned stalkerware ads, and the firm’s <a class="link"   href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/" >Threat Analysis Group <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is constantly publishing research on new commercial spyware strains and their potential targets. Google researchers frequently cover the privacy and security concerns posed by mobile spyware and they are the authors of investigative reports <a class="link"   href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/commercial-surveillance-vendors-google-tag-report/" >warning of the dangers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of the commercial spyware industry. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-iphones-security-keys-feature-to-protect-your-apple-id/" >How to use iPhone’s Security Keys feature to protect your Apple ID <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple has <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-refutes-anti-competitive-parent-control-app-claims-says-removal-was-for-security-user-privacy/" >cracked down <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on parental control apps, citing privacy-invading functions as the reason for removal. The company offers its own parental device control service called <a class="link"   href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/ios-12-screen-time-and-stronger-parental-controls/" >Screen Time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for parents who want to limit their child’s device usage. Furthermore, the company does not allow <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Building%5Fa%5FTrusted%5FEcosystem%5Ffor%5FMillions%5Fof%5FApps%5FA%5FThreat%5FAnalysis%5Fof%5FSideloading.pdf" >sideloading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -- that is, the installing of third-party apps from sources other than Apple’s App Store, and is quick to remove any iOS apps that display privacy-eroding functionality.</p><p>In 2022, Apple revealed the details of a <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2022/07/apple-expands-commitment-to-protect-users-from-mercenary-spyware/" >$10 million grant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to research ways to combat state-sponsored spyware. Recently, the company <a class="link"   href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2024/04/12/apple-issues-new-spyware-attack-warning-to-iphone-users/" >issued an alert <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to iPhone users in 92 countries, warning them of remote, targeted attacks launched by spyware operators. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135412/19272" target="_top" id="2135412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135412/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-parental-control-apps-spyware"><a href="#Are-parental-control-apps-spyware" class="headerlink" title="Are parental control apps spyware?"></a>Are parental control apps spyware?</h2><p>There are cyberthreats around every corner online, and while children often want a smartphone and to be on social media at a young age, parents want to be able to monitor what they are viewing and who they are interacting with online in order to protect them. </p><p>This is a responsible position to take in itself, but at their core, parental control apps are designed for surveillance.</p><p>The main issue is the capacity for abuse, twisting what may have been a product developed with good intentions into invasive software used for purposes that go beyond protecting a minor. Standalone parental control apps can be abused, and the permissions they require can be incredibly intrusive—not only for children but also for anyone’s privacy. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-parental-control-apps/" >The best parental control apps to keep your kids safe online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>A balance between a right to privacy and protection has to be maintained, and it’s a difficult tightrope to walk. With this in mind, both <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201304" >Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/families#topic=7327495" >Google <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> have introduced parental controls for Android devices, Chromebooks, iPhones, and iPads. These platforms focus on restricting screen time, locking and unlocking devices, and features such as permissions list management, restricting web content and app downloads, and purchase approvals. </p><p>However, they are limited in scope and you may not be able to use them once a child reaches a certain age – and at this point, you should consider, anyway, whether or not you should still monitor them so closely. </p><h4 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security"></a>Security</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"  title="The

I’ve tested this previously on <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/is-this-the-ultimate-wireless-car-charger-my-iphone-tells-me-yes/" >ESR’s in-car iPhone charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it works really well. If the iPhone isn’t going to fall off inside a truck bouncing across rough roads, it’s not going to fall off on your nightstand. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The other word is “CryoBoost”. There’s a fan built into the wireless charging head to keep it cool in use. Again, this is <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/is-this-the-ultimate-wireless-car-charger-my-iphone-tells-me-yes/" >the same charging head that I tested in my truck in the hot sun <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it did an amazing job of keeping my iPhone cool while charging. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/is-this-the-ultimate-wireless-car-charger-my-iphone-tells-me-yes/" >Is this the ultimate wireless car charger? My iPhone tells me yes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I appreciate that this kit comes with a charger. Quite a few of the others I’ve tried require you to buy your own, which isn’t a huge problem. But having everything you need in the box is a nice touch and prevents confusion on the owner’s part. </p><p>Charger included.</p><p>Adrian Kingsley-Hughes&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Before you can charge your Apple Watch you will need to find your Apple Watch charger, as you’ll need to attach this to the charging station. </p><p>Now, previous ones I’ve tested have needed a USB-A version of the Apple Watch charger. I spent a good half hour looking for one before realizing that this charging station can accommodate both USB-A and USB-C flavors of the Apple Watch charging cable. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-keeps-selling-out-of-this-3-in-1-charging-cube-i-tested-one-to-see-if-its-worth-the-wait/"><strong>Apple keeps selling out of this 3-in-1 charging cube. I tested one to see if it’s worth the wait</strong></a> </p><p>To fit the Apple Watch charging cable, you need to unclip the base and thread the charging cable into the slot cut in the base. And I have to say, I’m impressed by the precision of this slot. </p><p>I mean, take a look at it. </p><p>The precision of the slot of the Apple Watch charging cable is impressive.</p><p>Adrian Kingsley-Hughes&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Another feature that I appreciate is the sleep mode feature. Too many nightstand charging stations are a Christmas tree of eye-piercing LED lights. A single button on this charging station turns off the LEDs and the fan, ensuring that you have a good night’s sleep. </p><p>As I said earlier, I’ve been using this charging station for several weeks now, and I’ve had no problem at all. The charger unit is sturdy and made very well, the magnets do a fine job of holding the iPhone and AirPods Pro in place, and the unit charges everything just as you’d expect. Oh, and night mode means you don’t have to try to sleep next to a pile of glowing LEDs. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-accessory/"><strong>The best

I thus turn to a couple of tools to help me access iMessages while using Windows.</p><p>Built into Windows, Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-starts-official-roll-out-of-phone-link-for-ios-with-imessage-support/" >Phone Link app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lets you view your recent texts, create new messages, and respond to existing texts. Any texts you send and receive automatically sync between your PC and your iPhone, so you can pick up an ongoing conversation on either device.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-link-your-android-phone-to-your-windows-11-pc/" >How to link your Android phone to your Windows 11 PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-takes-a-crack-at-getting-windows-pcs-to-connect-seamlessly-with-android-phones-and-iphones/" >Intel Unison <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another app that will perform the same tricks and even let you add emojis and items pasted from the Windows clipboard. According to Intel, Unison works only on Evo-powered laptops running on its 13th-generation or higher processors. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/what-is-intel-evo-a-recipe-for-the-most-portable-longest-lasting-laptops" >Evo designation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> means that the PC has passed strict requirements from Intel, and such machines should have a label that identifies them as meeting these specifications.</p><p>The good news is that many people have reported being able to install Unison on older, non-Evo computers. I use Unison on an Intel 11th-Gen non-Evo laptop with no trouble, so you’ll want to try this on your PC, even if it’s an older model.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>There’s just one sticking point: Neither app supports Windows 10. Phone Link and Intel Unison each require Windows 11. If you run the latest version of Windows, here’s how to use these tools with your texts.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-send-and-receive-iMessages-on-Windows"><a href="#How-to-send-and-receive-iMessages-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="How to send and receive iMessages on Windows"></a>How to send and receive iMessages on Windows</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Use-Microsoft-Phone-Link"><a href="#Use-Microsoft-Phone-Link" class="headerlink" title="Use Microsoft Phone Link"></a>Use Microsoft Phone Link</h2><p>Before you can use Phone Link, you’ll have to take care of a few items on your phone and your PC.</p><p>Your iPhone must have iOS 14 or higher. To confirm this, go to Settings, select General, and tap Software Update. You’ll be told that iOS is up-to-date or prompted to install the latest update. Next, go to Settings, select Bluetooth, and confirm that Bluetooth is turned on.</p><p>Microsoft added iPhone support to Phone Link in Windows 11 in early 2023. To make sure your operating system is up-to-date, head to Settings, select Windows Update, and click the button to check for updates. Allow the latest updates to download and install.</p><p>Next, confirm that you’re running the latest version of Phone Link. To do this, open the Microsoft Store app from the Start menu and click the Library icon. Click the Get Updates button and allow all your installed apps to be updated, including Phone Link if necessary.</p><p>Finally, ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on your Windows 11 PC. Go to Settings, select Bluetooth &amp; devices, and turn on the switch for Bluetooth if it’s off.</p><h2 id="1-Open-Phone-Link"><a href="#1-Open-Phone-Link" class="headerlink" title="1.

Scan the QR codes</h2><p>A QR code should appear in the Phone Link app. Launch the camera on your iPhone and scan the code. On your iPhone, tap the link at the bottom of the camera screen to pair your devices. If you can’t scan the code for any reason, click the link to continue manually without a QR code and follow those steps.</p><p>At the screen to pair your devices, tap “Link to Windows” to download and install the Link to Windows app. After the app has been installed, tap Open to launch it. Tap “Scan QR code” and scan the code displayed in the Phone Link app on your PC. Next, tap Continue to start pairing your phone and PC.</p><p>You should see pairing prompts on both your iPhone and your Windows 11 computer. Select the Pair button on both devices and wait for the two to pair.</p><p>Screenshot by Lance Whitney&#x2F;ZDNET</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484945/16446" target="_top" id="1484945">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484945" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484945/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Sync-your-iPhone-data"><a href="#3-Sync-your-iPhone-data" class="headerlink" title="3.

In fact, its ample range of sports and activity tracking features pretty much guarantee it’s going to be put in situations where a dropped barbell, incoming fastball, or even just a simple tumble could spell disaster for its display. Peripheral makers realized this before the first Apple Watch models ever reached consumers, and immediately began churning out solutions to protect against these very expensive accidents. </p><p>Ranging from simple films to complete, watertight cases, these products can completely deflect a blow that might have cracked or chipped a screen or, at worst, take the hit for their companion Apple Watch and be replaced far more cheaply than it could. </p><p>This list provides a cross-section of some of the best options currently available. Whether you’re shopping for a stealthy, but protective screen film, or a ruggedized, no-holds-barred full enclosure, we’ve selected the best options for keeping your pricey smartwatch nice and safe, no matter what traumas you may subject it to. </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K37CV3C?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca7a981a7-0cf3-466c-9f4d-e2f9d943080e%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Catalyst-Protective-Waterproof-Case"><a href="#Catalyst-Protective-Waterproof-Case" class="headerlink" title="Catalyst Protective Waterproof Case"></a>Catalyst Protective Waterproof Case</h2><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-screen-protector"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-screen-protector" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch screen protector"></a>Best Apple Watch screen protector</h3><p>It may seem a bit odd that one of the most ruggedized Apple Watch screen protectors on this list doesn’t actually cover the device’s display. Instead, it surrounds it with one of the beefiest enclosures we were able to find, including raised bezels that greatly reduce the chance of anything impacting the display. </p><p>The Catalyst Waterproof Case is also one of the few options that even enclose the smartwatch’s Digital Crown, providing a water-tight seal that Catalyst claims can essentially double the unit’s 164-foot of water resistance to 330 feet. </p><p>This is, however, an option that is really only for those that expect to be wearing their Apple Watch in the most extreme conditions. As such, it does come with some sacrifices, including a lack of ECG support due to encasing the necessary buttons, and a permanent band that does not officially support being replaced. </p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Raised bezels to protect display</li><li>Full enclosure, including Digital Crown</li><li>Waterproof to 330 feet</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Pricey</li><li>Blocks ECG Sensor</li></ul><p>Supported Models: Apple Watch Series 3,4,5,6, and SE</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HSS4KYJ?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca7a981a7-0cf3-466c-9f4d-e2f9d943080e%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Spigen-Rugged-Armor-Protector"><a href="#Spigen-Rugged-Armor-Protector" class="headerlink" title="Spigen Rugged Armor Protector"></a>Spigen Rugged Armor Protector</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144309/7443" target="_top" id="2144309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144309/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-affordable-full-enclosure"><a href="#Best-affordable-full-enclosure" class="headerlink" title="Best affordable full enclosure"></a>Best affordable full enclosure</h3><p>Spigen is a brand that should be well known to most people that have shopped for a smartphone case in the past decade. Their affordable and varied enclosures tend to sit at the top of Amazon review metrics and consistently provide solid, affordable protection for the devices installed in them.</p><p>This entry into the company’s offerings attempts to find a balance between a ruggedized, full enclosure and unrestricted access to all functions of the Apple Watch. This includes leaving the Digital Crown bare to maintain ECG functionality for models that support it, and using a thin backplate that doesn’t interfere with the official Apple Watch charger. </p><p>Although most are unlikely to peg this option as being fashion-forward, Spigen has attempted to cushion the potential blow to any wearer’s aesthetic by making it available in Black, Navy Blue, Olive Green, Rose Gold, and White. Certainly, it’s not the stealthiest accessory, but it provides an excellent level of protection to the wearer’s wrist-worn investment without as many compromises as the Catalyst option seen above.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Maintains ECG functionality</li><li>Available in five colors</li><li>Raised bezels for screen protection</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Rugged looks may not play well for formal settings</li><li>No direct protection from scratching for display</li></ul><p>Supported Models: Apple Watch Series 4,5,6,7, and SE</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089ZRVKC4?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca7a981a7-0cf3-466c-9f4d-e2f9d943080e%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Smiling-Case-Overall-Protective-Hard-PC-Case-Ultra-Thin-Cover"><a href="#Smiling-Case-Overall-Protective-Hard-PC-Case-Ultra-Thin-Cover" class="headerlink" title="Smiling Case Overall Protective Hard PC Case Ultra-Thin Cover"></a>Smiling Case Overall Protective Hard PC Case Ultra-Thin Cover</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006941/19272" target="_top" id="2006941">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006941" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006941/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-almost-invisible-option"><a href="#Best-almost-invisible-option" class="headerlink" title="Best almost invisible option"></a>Best almost invisible option</h3><p>The Smiling Case is, as the name might suggest, one of the slew of OEM options in this product category that can be found on Amazon. However, its reviews and its rare combination of a built-in, tempered glass screen cover with a full enclosure design make it a standout among those hundreds of other options. </p><p>While a full enclosure can never be truly invisible, this protector is about as close as you can get. Using clear plastic and tempered glass, a bystander might actually miss it at a casual glance. Despite its stealth, the product still provides protection for the metal sides and display, while promising accurate and responsive pass-through of all touch commands. </p><p>The only downside for some users might be the cover’s interference with the Digital Crown and Side Button. Although it lives up to its “Ultra-Thin” monicker, it still reduces the protrusion of the crown, making it slightly harder to turn, while also adding a recess users will need to reach into to depress the Side Button. If this seems like too much inconvenience, then a full enclosure likely just isn’t the best option for you.</p><p>Pros: </p><ul><li>Includes tempered glass screen cover</li><li>Clear shell provides no aesthetic changes</li><li>Maintains ECG functionality</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>May make use of Digital Crown and Side Button slightly more difficult</li><li>Not from a well-known brand</li></ul><p>Supported Models: Apple Watch Series 4,5,6,7, and SE</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RLZP5XX?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca7a981a7-0cf3-466c-9f4d-e2f9d943080e%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="LK-Screen-Protector"><a href="#LK-Screen-Protector" class="headerlink" title="LK Screen Protector"></a>LK Screen Protector</h2><h3 id="Best-screen-only-film"><a href="#Best-screen-only-film" class="headerlink" title="Best screen-only film"></a>Best screen-only film</h3><p>For wearers that want to protect their unit’s display, but just can’t stand the idea of covering any of the Apple Watch’s visual appeal, the LK Screen Protector is an excellent option. Made of “Self-Healing” TPU, the skin is designed to provide 99% transparency and complete retention of screen sensitivity and responsiveness.</p><p>In addition to being able to automatically remove bubbles under the film following installation, LK also promises that the film will heal any scratches the user may subject it to within 24 hours of their appearance. Even if this weren’t the case, the low cost for a large multi-pack means that replacing the screen protector barely costs more than one dollar. </p><p>Of course, films like this and the SuperShields option below will protect from scratches, and may help to ward off minor impacts. But, they will do little to prevent damage from severe blows. For owners expecting that type of abuse, we suggest one of the sturdier, albeit far more noticeable options towards the top of this list.</p><p>Pros: </p><ul><li>TPU material rejects bubbles and “heals” scratches within 24 hours</li><li>Easy application with included kit</li><li>Inexpensive multi-pack options</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>No protection for edges and little protection from severe impacts</li><li>Edge of protector may be noticeable to sensitive fingers while using touchscreen.</li></ul><p>Supported models: Apple Watch Series 6,7, and SE.</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J2C53CC?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca7a981a7-0cf3-466c-9f4d-e2f9d943080e%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934188/19272" target="_top" id="1934188">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934188" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934188/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="IQ-Shield-Matte-Screen-Protector"><a href="#IQ-Shield-Matte-Screen-Protector" class="headerlink" title="IQ Shield Matte Screen Protector"></a>IQ Shield Matte Screen Protector</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115946/19272" target="_top" id="2115946">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115946" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115946/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-anti-glare-film"><a href="#Best-anti-glare-film" class="headerlink" title="Best anti-glare film"></a>Best anti-glare film</h3><p>The IQ Shield option shown here addresses an issue that no other entry on this list does: glare. Anyone that’s struggled to see what their Apple Watch was trying to tell them while outdoors or directly under a harsh overhead light should appreciate the possibility of having those bothersome reflections reduced or eliminated by the matte finish on the IQ Shield Screen Protector. </p><p>IQ Shield is also somewhat unique in designing its flexible film to fit right up against the curved edges of the Apple Watch display, something many manufacturers skip in favor of a smaller, rectangular film with visible edges. This “precise fitment” not only improves the appearance of the protector, but also helps eliminate the annoying sensation of running over the edge of a screen protector when using the Apple Watch touchscreen.</p><p>Like most matte-finish films, the IQ Shield version does have some minimal impact on things like screen brightness and color accuracy. However, the benefit of not having to fight bright outside lights, especially when trying to view the somewhat dimmer displays on older Apple Watch models, will likely be more than enough to make up for any modest impact on image quality.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Matte finish blocks glare</li><li>Designed specifically to wrap around screen edges</li><li>Inexpensive multi-pack options</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Could slightly impact screen clarity or color accuracy</li><li>Won’t protect from severe impacts</li></ul><p>Supported Models: Apples Watch Series 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, and SE.</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-screen-protectors"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-screen-protectors" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these screen protectors?"></a>How did we choose these screen protectors?</h2><p>The range of abuses an Apple Watch could see in its life is as varied and diverse as the user base it serves. Because of these, we’ve chosen a range of products for an assorted clientele. We feel each of these offerings is the best of the best in their particular slot of this product category. That said, it would be silly to compare a ruggedized, complete enclosure to a simple screen film. Obviously the former offers the most protection, but the latter may be preferable for users unwilling to accept any aesthetic sacrifices in the name of safety and protection for their Apple Watch. This is why each of these options includes a note or two about their ideal user, and where that user’s priorities may lie on the spectrums of form over function and protection versus visibility. </p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-screen-protector"><a href="#What-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-screen-protector" class="headerlink" title="What is the best Apple Watch screen protector?"></a>What is the best Apple Watch screen protector?</h2><p>The best Apple Watch screen protector is the Catalyst Protective Waterproof Case, because it is waterproof, extremely durable, and well designed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135416/19272" target="_top" id="2135416">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135416" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135416/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Do-I-really-need-a-screen-protector"><a href="#Do-I-really-need-a-screen-protector" class="headerlink" title="Do I really need a screen protector?"></a>Do I really need a screen protector?</h2><p> This is, of course, a personal decision. For some, even the most inexpensive Apple Watch can be a major investment, well worth protecting. For others, the idea of damaging their watch’s hardy Ion-X glass may be unlikely enough, or inconsequential enough that they would prefer to just take the risk and pay for repairs, if needed. Ultimately, it’s a matter of budgeting for the cost of potential future repairs versus the definite cost and possible aesthetic blow resulting from adding some form of screen protector.</p><h2 id="What-if-I-have-AppleCare-for-my-Apple-Watch"><a href="#What-if-I-have-AppleCare-for-my-Apple-Watch" class="headerlink" title="What if I have AppleCare+ for my Apple Watch?"></a>What if I have AppleCare+ for my Apple Watch?</h2><p>Apple’s well-known AppleCare+ program has saved many a device from an early grave. However, it’s important to understand the AppleCare+ policy on “accidental damage,” which any cracking or chipping of the display would fall under. According to Apple, each Watch owner qualifies for up to 2 accidental repairs per year. While this seems generous enough for all but the clumsiest owners, it also comes with a $69 fee for each of these repairs. That’s in addition to the initial $79 cost of the extended warranty. Any repeat offender maxing out their yearly repair allowance is going to very quickly rack up quite a bill for screen replacements, and may want to consider just adding a screen protector instead.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948909/19272" target="_top" id="1948909">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948909" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948909/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-a-screen-protector-void-my-warranty"><a href="#Will-a-screen-protector-void-my-warranty" class="headerlink" title="Will a screen protector void my warranty?"></a>Will a screen protector void my warranty?</h2><p>The short answer: no. Most screen protectors of any decent quality can easily be removed without leaving any sign that they were ever present. Since it’s always a good idea to remove any aftermarket accessories from any electronic device before bringing it in for service, Apple will likely never know the screen protector existed, and wouldn’t much care, even if it did. </p><h2 id="Which-screen-protector-is-right-for-you"><a href="#Which-screen-protector-is-right-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Which screen protector is right for you?"></a>Which screen protector is right for you?</h2><p>The selections here were chosen to represent the full spectrum of options available. The most important thing in determining where your priorities fall within this range of products is deciding whether aesthetics are more important than protection, or vice-versa. The fashion-conscious among us probably wouldn’t be caught dead in some of the ruggedized options near the top of the list, while the extreme athletes out there might chuckle at the relatively meager protection offered by a simple screen film. You have to decide how much of an aesthetic sacrifice you’re willing to make in the name of protecting your Apple Watch.</p><h4 id="ZDNET-Recommends-1"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends-1" class="headerlink"

We saw design changes, hardware updates, the implementation of Apple Intelligence, and more. The presentation was packed with reveals; both big and small. So to make things easy for you, we’re highlighting four of the best features for the iPhone 16 line.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Apple-Intelligence"><a href="#1-Apple-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="1. Apple Intelligence"></a>1. Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Screenshot by Kayla Solino&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Siri has finally received its long-awaited update, becoming “smarter” than ever before. The AI assistant has a richer understanding of language thanks to Apple Intelligence. Siri can now maintain context even when a user makes multiple requests. Plus it can continue following along even if you stumble over your words. If you have any burning questions about any Apple products, the AI has more extensive product knowledge to help you shop.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/" >The 5 best iPhone 16 Pro features that enthusiasts will care about <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The updates don’t stop there. Apple Intelligence enables so much more. They include but are not limited to, Writing Tools to help you edit text, call recordings for the Phone app, notification summaries, and Private Cloud Compute for enhancing the device’s processing power. </p><p>Apple Intelligence will not be available at launch. It’ll roll out in October as a software upgrade in the United States and in English only. It’ll be available in more countries like the United Kingdom later this December. And in 2025, it’ll expand to other languages like Spanish.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886048/19272" target="_top" id="1886048">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886048" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886048/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Camera-Upgrades"><a href="#2-Camera-Upgrades" class="headerlink" title="2. Camera Upgrades"></a>2. Camera Upgrades</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Apple showed off so many camera updates at the event that it is impossible to talk about every single one in detail, but we’re going to try. First, the main lens on the iPhone 16 will be the new 48MP Fusion Camera. It can take wide-angle shots like previous generations. Now it sports a 2x Telephoto option for taking clear pictures from far away. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/" >The 5 best iPhone 16 Pro features that enthusiasts will care about <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Below the power button is a new tactile switch called <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/" >Camera Control <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is a special sensor allowing you to control the camera with a few light touches. A light tap instantly opens the Camera app and a few more light touches can be used to adjust the composition. You can zoom in on a subject, adjust the exposure, or change the depth of view. The best part of Camera Control is it’ll soon become accessible on third-party apps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036486/19272" target="_top" id="2036486">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036486" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036486/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Eye-catching-colors"><a href="#3-Eye-catching-colors" class="headerlink" title="3. Eye-catching colors"></a>3. Eye-catching colors</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Every generation of iPhones brings with it new colors. For this release, Apple decided to go bold. The shades are some of the most vibrant we’ve seen in the series, especially that bubble-gum Pink iPhone. You also have the option to go for Ultramarine Blue or muted Teal Green. Of course, you still have the classic options of Black and White. </p><p>The Pro models go for a more striking design. Desert Titanium adorns their brushed metal, making the iPhones look like they’ve been forged from bronze. If you prefer something a little more low-key, the Pro models are available in the equally impressive Black, White, and Natural Titanium too.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880940/19272" target="_top" id="1880940">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880940" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880940/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Design-changes-bring-other-benefits"><a href="#4-Design-changes-bring-other-benefits" class="headerlink" title="4. Design changes bring other benefits"></a>4. Design changes bring other benefits</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>There’s more to the iPhone 16’s design besides color as Apple made multiple changes. We’ve already talked about the camera array and the Camera Control switch. What you may not know is the company made its mobile device tougher. It is covered in the “latest-generation Ceramic Shield”, making the iPhone 16 15% more durable than before. The glass has also been twice as tough to withstand drops.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-be-updated-to-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/" >Every iPhone model that will be updated to Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones won’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple even updated the iPhone 16’s internal design, allowing the device to dissipate heat better. This means lower internal temperatures, which results in a healthier battery. The optimization allowed for more room, too, resulting in an even larger battery. The base model can last up to 22 hours on a single charge. The Action Button makes a return, giving users quick access to various functions, from activating the Translate tool to turning on Shazam.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/"  title="20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really">20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/"  title="Want a programming job?

Plus, ChatGPT has myriad other uses, from writing professional emails and resumes to generating code or spreadsheet formulas. These amazing browser extensions augment ChatGPT’s abilities to make the AI responses and prompts better than ever.</p><p> While some of the extensions improve the ChatGPT app, others use the AI’s abilities in other webapps (such as Gmail) to improve the experience there. Do note that all but of one of these extensions require you to have a registered free account on OpenAI’s ChatGPT portal.</p><h2 id="1-WebChatGPT"><a href="#1-WebChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="1. WebChatGPT"></a>1. WebChatGPT</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/best-chatgpt-browser-extensions-chrome-webchatgpt.jpg"                      alt="WebChatGPT takes your ChatGPT prompt and performs a search query with it first, and then instructs ChatGPT to use those search results while answering your query so that its data is more updated"                ></p><p> As impressive as ChatGPT’s answers are, it’s still limited. If you know<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/" >how ChatGPT works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll know that it isn’t scraping the internet for the latest information about any topic or news. The AI works on older data and doesn’t search the internet. WebChatGPT is an innovative workaround for this problem that adds web search results to ChatGPT.</p><p> Here’s how it works. Once you install the extension and open ChatGPT, you’ll see a bar under the usual dialog box for queries and prompts. Toggle the<strong>Search the Web</strong> button to activate WebChatGPT and select parameters. You can ask it to search for up to 10 results, set how far back it’ll search for links (day, week, month, year), and set a region.</p><p> When you give ChatGPT any prompt, it’ll conduct a web search and gather the results. Then, the extension automatically frames a revised prompt that includes those latest results and your original query, instructing ChatGPT to scan and include the results.</p><p> The final output from the AI thus gives you more up-to-date information, such as news summaries, sports statistics, weather reports and forecasts, and stock market updates.</p><p> You can customize the default revised prompt that WebChatGPT uses, but as a new user, we wouldn’t suggest that. Once you’re more accustomed to using this extension, feel free to look into options that improve your queries</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> WebChatGPT for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-advanced/lpfemeioodjbpieminkklglpmhlngfcn" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-chatgpt/" >Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="2-ChatGPT-Prompt-Genius"><a href="#2-ChatGPT-Prompt-Genius" class="headerlink" title="2.

But those screenshots don’t show the prompts users have typed to make ChatGPT better. Like<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-google-search-tips-pdf/" >learning the best Google search operators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you need to know how to frame the right prompts for ChatGPT. And this extension can help.</p><p> ChatGPT Prompt Genius is like a cheatsheet for prompts to feed the AI. The extension gathers user-generated prompts for various functions and tasks through a<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/" >Subreddit community <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> With the extension, you can quickly run these in ChatGPT or filter them to browse through categories such as academic writing, business, learning, fun and games, fiction writing, non-fiction writing, programming, social media, speeches, scripts, etc.</p><p> The more you discover and import these prompts and customize them to your needs, the more you’ll learn how to write specific questions that ChatGPT can understand and answer.</p><p> You can curate and save your recently used prompts if you want to reuse them later. The extension lets you save entire chats with the ChatGPT AI as a PDF, PNG, or Markdown HTML file directly from the browser. You can also use custom themes for the chat interface, but that’s more about looks than function.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> ChatGPT Prompt Genius for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-history/jjdnakkfjnnbbckhifcfchagnpofjffo/" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatgpt-history/" >Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="3-ChatGPT-Writer"><a href="#3-ChatGPT-Writer" class="headerlink" title="3.

ChatGPT Writer</h2><p> When someone sends a professional email your way for something like a meeting or a job opportunity, it’s bad form to reply with a one or two-line email (even if that sums up everything you want to say). ChatGPT Writer takes your intended reply and generates a long, professional-sounding email message.</p><p> The extension works with all email services but is specially primed for Gmail, offering a button next to<strong>Send</strong> in the<strong>Compose</strong> message box. When you fire up ChatGPT Writer, you’ll see the original email and find a box to enter what you want to reply briefly.</p><p> You can make it a simple and easy command; for example, “Write a reply to this email about my interest in the job and seek information about salary.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chatgpt-writer-1.jpg"                      alt="an email reply using chatgpt writer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016148/19272" target="_top" id="2016148">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016148" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016148/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> ChatGPT Writer will take a few seconds and then compose a long, professional message along those lines. You can change or edit any words within the box, or redo your prompt if it’s not satisfactory. When you’re happy with the result, insert it directly into the<strong>Reply</strong> box, and you’re ready to send it.</p><p> The first time you use ChatpGPT Writer, you’ll need to log in to your OpenAI account with it. The extension works with any Chromium browser such as Chrome, Brave, or Edge. While it’s currently best for replying to professional emails, you can also give it non-work prompts to write casual and personal email messages.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> ChatGPT Writer for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-writer-write-mail/pdnenlnelpdomajfejgapbdpmjkfpjkp/" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="4-YouTube-Summary-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#4-YouTube-Summary-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="4. YouTube Summary With ChatGPT"></a>4. YouTube Summary With ChatGPT</h2><p> YouTube creators have the option to add a transcript of their full video or not. As a user, you have no control over this. Many times, all you want is a transcript to quickly browse through what the video is going to say so that you can know if it’s worth your time.</p><p> Install YouTube Summary With ChatGPT and go to any video. The right sidebar now has a box for<strong>Transcript &amp; Summary</strong> , clicking which will open a time-stamped transcript of the video generated by ChatGPT.</p><p> Click any timestamp to be taken to that moment in the video. If you’re already midway through the video, you can jump to the current time in the transcript. And you can copy-paste the transcript anywhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/youtube-summary-extension.jpg"                      alt="using the &#39;transcript and summary box&#39; from youtube summary extension"                ></p><p> The extension also has a button to view an AI-generated summary of the video. Clicking this takes you to ChatGPT, with the transcript already typed in the prompt. All you have to do now is prompt ChatGPT to summarize the text, and you’ll get an instant summary.</p><p> You can also add further prompts for more details regarding specific parts of the video without having to watch the full thing.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> YouTube Summary With ChatGPT for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-summary-with-chat/nmmicjeknamkfloonkhhcjmomieiodli" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/glasp-social-web-highlighter/id1605690124" >Safari <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049382/7443" target="_top" id="2049382">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049382" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049382/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Talk-to-ChatGPT"><a href="#5-Talk-to-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="5. Talk-to-ChatGPT"></a>5. Talk-to-ChatGPT</h2><p> ChatGPT is currently a text-only AI app where the prompts and the answers are written. But Google Chrome offers some excellent voice commands and text-to-speech features. Talk-to-ChatGPT bridges this gap to let you issue prompts by talking to your computer and having the ChatGPT answers read aloud by AI.</p><p> Once you install the extension, refresh the ChatGPT tab once, and press<strong>Start</strong> in the extension to allow access. A floating panel in the top-right of your screen shows whether it’s active or not, and you can toggle it to record, playback audio to read the answers or pause.</p><p> Talk-to-ChatGPT is an open-source extension that lets you fiddle around with the settings. You can choose from different AI voices, the voice pitch, and the speed at which text is read. It also supports voice command shortcuts of “Stop” and “Pause” to control playback.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Talk-to-ChatGPT for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/talk-to-chatgpt/hodadfhfagpiemkeoliaelelfbboamlk" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="6-ChatGPT-for-Search-Engines"><a href="#6-ChatGPT-for-Search-Engines" class="headerlink" title="6.

It also works with Bing, but you don’t need that anymore, given Microsoft has already officially integrated the two.</p><p> You’ll find the AI answers in the right sidebar next to regular search results. The extension can run for every search, for keywords that end with a question mark, or you can trigger it manually when you want to. Clicking the extension icon opens a shortcut to run a ChatGPT query directly through a drop-down panel.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> ChatGPT for Search Engines for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-for-search-engine/feeonheemodpkdckaljcjogdncpiiban/" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatgpt-for-search-engines/" >Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/chatgpt-for-search-engine/pnglghgjhaklojnjpkhcdidgalehmkbn" >Edge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975503">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975503.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975503">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975503.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975503%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975503/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Perplexity-AI"><a href="#7-Perplexity-AI" class="headerlink" title="7.

But, like anything in tech, it carries an ugly side to it, too. The rise of fake news and misinformation, for instance, is one of its biggest unwanted by-products.</p><p> Perplexity AI can help you cut the misinformation out. Indeed, as the developers put it, the tool works as a combination of Google and ChatGPT. Simply type in your query in the extension and the tool will summarize you the best possible result—along with the legitimate cited sources. The last part here is very important.</p><p> While the tool summarizes the information in a neat manner, it ends the answers with a quick mention of the best, legitimate sources. And while there’s still a possibility of fault here (you’d still need to rely on the sources that Perplexity provides), we believe it’s much better than going in blind with the usual, source-less responses you’d otherwise gotten from ChatGPT.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Perplexity AI for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perplexity-ai-companion/hlgbcneanomplepojfcnclggenpcoldo" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-Is-Awesome-But-Be-Realistic…"><a href="#ChatGPT-Is-Awesome-But-Be-Realistic…" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Is Awesome, But Be Realistic…"></a>ChatGPT Is Awesome, But Be Realistic…</h2><p> With these extensions including search results in ChatGPT, showing you how to use the right prompts, and using AI to improve YouTube or Gmail, you might think it’s time to offload a majority of your work to ChatGPT. But take a breath.</p><p> Yes, the AI capabilities are amazing compared to what has existed before this, but ChatGPT isn’t ready for prime-time yet. It still has a long way to go and depends largely upon the user keying in the right prompts. The data that it bases its answers on can also leave a lot to be desired in certain cases. For now, feel free to use it, but don’t rely wholly on it, and take those results with a pinch of salt.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-add-music-to-powerpoint/"><u>[New] Add Music to PowerPoint</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-spotlight-on-snapchat-utilization-strategies/"><u>[New] In 2024, Spotlight on Snapchat Utilization Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-crafting-cool-youtube-previews-in-imovie-easily/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Crafting Cool YouTube Previews in iMovie Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/guide-to-unlocking-siris-feature-of-reading-aloud-on-iphones-and-macbooks/"><u>Guide to Unlocking Siri's Feature of Reading Aloud on iPhones and MacBooks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-the-newly-upgraded-palm-2-algorithm-enhances-googles-bard-ai/"><u>How the Newly Upgraded PaLM 2 Algorithm Enhances Google's Bard AI</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-to-effectively-set-health-goals-with-chatgpt/"><u>How to Effectively Set Health Goals With ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-in-other-languages/"><u>How to Use ChatGPT in Other Languages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-will-artificial-intelligence-impact-mental-wellness-advancements-and-challenges/"><u>How Will Artificial Intelligence Impact Mental Wellness: Advancements and Challenges</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/in-2024-captivating-titles-easily-achievable/"><u>In 2024, Captivating Titles, Easily Achievable</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/is-it-appropriate-to-use-good-manners-with-digital-companebots-such-as-chatgpt-alexa-or-siri/"><u>Is It Appropriate to Use Good Manners With Digital Companebots Such as ChatGPT, Alexa, or Siri?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/is-it-safe-to-use-chatgpt-understanding-its-potential-vulnerabilities/"><u>Is It Safe To Use ChatGPT: Understanding Its Potential Vulnerabilities?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/is-solo-operation-of-auto-gpt-justifiable/"><u>Is Solo Operation of Auto-GPT Justifiable?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/mastering-generative-ai-key-mistakes-and-how-to-prevent-them/"><u>Mastering Generative AI: Key Mistakes and How to Prevent Them</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/optimize-video-posts-a-comprehensive-crop-and-export-method/"><u>Optimize Video Posts A Comprehensive Crop & Export Method</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/overcoming-recurring-palworld-game-crashes-a-comprehnensive-guide-for-windows-users/"><u>Overcoming Recurring Palworld Game Crashes: A Comprehnensive Guide for Windows Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/say-goodbye-to-arma-3-game-freezes-innovative-fixes-and-optimization-tips-released/"><u>Say Goodbye to Arma 3 Game Freezes: Innovative Fixes & Optimization Tips Released</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/unraveling-the-mysteries-ai-and-vector-database-relationship/"><u>Unraveling the Mysteries: AI and Vector Database Relationship</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Can-AI-Be-a-Friend-or-Foe-to-Psychological-Care-Exploring-the-Effects-on-Treatment-and-Support-Services"><a href="#Can-AI-Be-a-Friend-or-Foe-to-Psychological-Care-Exploring-the-Effects-on-Treatment-and-Support-Services" class="headerlink" title="Can AI Be a Friend or Foe to Psychological Care? Exploring the Effects on Treatment and Support Services"></a>Can AI Be a Friend or Foe to Psychological Care? Exploring the Effects on Treatment and Support Services</h2><p> There’s no denying that AI usage is on the rise, be it in manufacturing, education, cybersecurity, or even transport. But with this growing AI prevalence, should you be at all concerned about your mental health? Will AI improve or worsen mental health across the board?</p><h2 id="How-Can-AI-Improve-Mental-Health"><a href="#How-Can-AI-Improve-Mental-Health" class="headerlink" title="How Can AI Improve Mental Health?"></a>How Can AI Improve Mental Health?</h2><p> AI is already a big deal in a number of industries, including healthcare, transport, and finance. But you may not know that AI is also being experimented with in the mental health realm.</p><p> Through this, researchers may be able to find new ways of supporting mental health patients and developing better forms of treatment. At the time of writing, AI is still in its infancy in terms of mental health applications, but this technology has a lot of potential in the mental healthcare industry.</p><p> So, how, exactly, might AI prove useful here, and in what ways may it pose a risk?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137203/26400" target="_top" id="2137203">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137203" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137203/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Providing-Instant-Advice-and-Support-Using-AI"><a href="#Providing-Instant-Advice-and-Support-Using-AI" class="headerlink" title="Providing Instant Advice and Support Using AI"></a>Providing Instant Advice and Support Using AI</h3><p> Finding a therapist can take a long time, and can even be an inaccessible option for some due to its high cost. So, when someone needs advice and support immediately, who can they turn to?</p><p> There are hotlines for those seeking support, but talking to a real person about your problems can be daunting. So, using artificial intelligence, an individual may be able to access advice remotely without having to talk to a real person. This can alleviate the social anxiety associated with discussing personal issues, while also ensuring that the person struggling receives some form of support.</p><p> While regular chatbots can be used in such a scenario, an AI-powered chatbot will likely have the ability to communicate in a more personal way, further understand a person’s issue, and provide possible solutions or avenues. We’ve already seen how the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chat-gpt-generative-ai-explained/" >ChatGPT chatbot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can interact with users, so there’s likely some potential here for patient support.</p><p> Of course, some may see<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/dangers-using-ai-free-therapist-psychiatrist/" >using AI to provide mental health advice as risky <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . We’ll discuss the possible downsides of this a little later.</p><h3 id="Monitoring-Patient-Progress-With-AI"><a href="#Monitoring-Patient-Progress-With-AI" class="headerlink" title="Monitoring Patient Progress With AI"></a>Monitoring Patient Progress With AI</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/stetho-laptop-1.jpg"                      alt="person typing on laptop next to stethoscope on desk"                ></p><p> Monitoring a patient’s progress to ensure they’re not taking steps backward is a very important step in recovery. While a human professional can do this well, the number of individuals requiring mental health support makes it difficult for human personnel to keep up with the demand.</p><p> This is where AI might be able to help. Using this technology, a patient could give inputs on how they’re feeling and what they’ve been doing, and an AI system could then assess and evaluate the information provided to determine whether there is any cause for concern. The AI system could then alert the relevant parties so that action can be taken. This may lower the occurrences of mental health negligence, as a far greater number of people could be assessed regularly without the need for a human professional.</p><p> But there are risks to consider here, and the AI system in use would have to be very thoroughly trained on how to spot possible red flags. Still, simply using this as an initial assessment could prove highly beneficial, both to doctors and patients.</p><h3 id="Developing-New-Support-Techniques-With-AI"><a href="#Developing-New-Support-Techniques-With-AI" class="headerlink" title="Developing New Support Techniques With AI"></a>Developing New Support Techniques With AI</h3><p> There’s no denying that researchers are still working to further understand our brains and why they give way to mental illnesses. Not only is the origin of mental illness still being researched, but techniques on how to better treat patients are also being developed.</p><p> For example, an AI system may be able to take a batch of data about patient symptoms, triggers, or backgrounds, and then suggest new ways to help them make progress. This could be a medication suggestion, a kind of therapy, or similar.</p><p> On top of this, AI has been proven to detect the presence of mental illnesses with a relatively high rate of accuracy. In a<a class="link"   href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt9gx593b0/qt9gx593b0%5FnoSplash%5Fd814b6b41c76cb874050695d2bf30ced.pdf" >2019 psychiatry report by IBM and the University of California <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it was stated that, when testing AI in mental illness detection, accuracy ranged from 62 to 92 percent (depending on the AI system and training data used). While the lower ends of this range aren’t too impressive, continued development may allow AI systems to reach a consistently high accuracy rate when detecting mental illnesses.</p><p> Though this all seems very promising, there are also<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/is-ai-dangerous-5-immediate-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/" >dangers associated with using AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the mental health field and other ways that AI can worsen mental health in general.</p><h2 id="How-Can-AI-Worsen-Mental-Health"><a href="#How-Can-AI-Worsen-Mental-Health" class="headerlink" title="How Can AI Worsen Mental Health?"></a>How Can AI Worsen Mental Health?</h2><p> While AI has significant potential to improve mental healthcare, there are also risks and dangers in the adoption of this fast-evolving technology.</p><h3 id="Increased-Reliance-on-AI"><a href="#Increased-Reliance-on-AI" class="headerlink" title="Increased Reliance on AI"></a>Increased Reliance on AI</h3><p> Over the past few decades, the rise of smart technology has led many people to rely on phones, PCs, tablets, and other devices to simplify and enhance their lives. Whether they’re chatting on social media, streaming movies, browsing for new clothes, or simply getting some work done, technology usually stands as the backbone. Many people are even<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/smartphone-addiction-how-overcome-negative-habit/" >addicted to their smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or computers, which can have a huge impact on their lives.</p><p> So, when AI becomes prominent across various industries, it could have a detrimental effect on mental health. For instance, an individual may opt to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-teachers-embrace-ai/" >use AI for their education <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , work, entertainment, and other elements of their social life. This, in turn, may lead to something of an AI addiction. There are already plenty of people addicted to social media, online shopping, and online gaming today, which can often give way to feelings of anxiety and very real social and financial problems.</p><h3 id="Lack-of-Human-Contact"><a href="#Lack-of-Human-Contact" class="headerlink" title="Lack of Human Contact"></a>Lack of Human Contact</h3><p> Humans are, by nature, social beings. So, it can often be hugely beneficial to discuss your feelings with somebody else, instead of dealing with them alone.</p><p> But if AI becomes increasingly used in the mental health industry, accessing face-to-face treatment, such as talking therapy, may become even more challenging than it currently is. If AI is too frequently used as a replacement for human contact, a decline in recovery rates and patient progress may occur as a result.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hands-reaching-1.jpg"                      alt="hands reaching out to each other"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918698/19272" target="_top" id="1918698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> At the moment, humans are seen as much more effective at conducting therapy than machines, and this may always be the case.

This is a big concern when AI is being entrusted with people’s mental health. Misjudging someone’s state of mind, offering ineffective treatment, or misinterpreting important data could be catastrophic for the patient, so there are major considerations that need to be made here.</p><p> There are plenty of things that can go wrong while using AI, particularly as it is in its early stages. System malfunctions, software bugs, and improper training can all lead to issues, with malicious attacks also posing a possible risk.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087253/19272" target="_top" id="2087253">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087253" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087253/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="AI’s-Future-in-Mental-Health-Must-Be-Watched-Carefully"><a href="#AI’s-Future-in-Mental-Health-Must-Be-Watched-Carefully" class="headerlink" title="AI’s Future in Mental Health Must Be Watched Carefully"></a>AI’s Future in Mental Health Must Be Watched Carefully</h2><p> AI has so much potential that it’s no secret why people are so excited about it. However, as is the case with any emerging technology, it is crucial that AI is not too quickly applied or outright misused. In mental healthcare, this could do more harm than good to patients. Time will tell if, or when, AI becomes a key element in the mental health industry and whether this turns out to be a blessing or a curse.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-craft-your-story-aspect-ratios-for-powerful-yt-thumbnails/"><u>[New] In 2024, Craft Your Story Aspect Ratios for Powerful YT Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-transforming-daily-routine-into-a-social-media-journey-on-fb/"><u>[New] In 2024, Transforming Daily Routine Into a Social Media Journey on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-exploring-the-top-7-voice-customization-applications-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Exploring the Top 7 Voice Customization Applications for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-smoothly-record-your-desktop-on-win11/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Smoothly Record Your Desktop on Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-bits.techidaily.com/comprehensive-walkthrough-restoring-default-settings-via-windows-factory-reset-on-the-chuwi-hi10-laptop/"><u>Comprehensive Walkthrough: Restoring Default Settings via Windows Factory Reset on the Chuwi Hi10 Laptop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-wonderful.techidaily.com/guia-integral-para-backup-gratuito-ao-vivo-do-computador-windows-1011-para-evitar-a-perda-de-dados/"><u>Guia Integral Para Backup Gratuito Ao Vivo Do Computador Windows 10/11 Para Evitar a Perda De Dados</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-stream-apple-iphone-12-mini-to-computer-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Stream Apple iPhone 12 mini to Computer? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-game-film-mastery-using-fbx-recorder/"><u>In-Game Film Mastery Using FBX Recorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/reimagining-domestic-functionality-with-chatgpt-innovations/"><u>Reimagining Domestic Functionality with ChatGPT Innovations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/revolutionizing-development-with-ai/"><u>Revolutionizing Development with AI</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/the-6-best-large-language-models/"><u>The 6 Best Large Language Models</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/the-fact-files-on-fictional-ai-bots-top-9-reality-checks/"><u>The Fact Files on Fictional AI Bots - Top 9 Reality Checks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/the-future-of-poetry-publishing-writing-books-with-ai-assistance-from-chatgpt/"><u>The Future of Poetry Publishing: Writing Books with AI Assistance From ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/the-new-phase-of-dall-e-3-advanced-editing-options-a-work-in-progress/"><u>The New Phase of DALL-E 3: Advanced Editing Options - A Work in Progress</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/the-soundwaves-compreeved-websites-for-skype-audio/"><u>The Soundwaves Compreeved Websites for Skype Audio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/top-7-leading-artificial-intelligence-based-prompt-services/"><u>Top 7 Leading Artificial Intelligence-Based Prompt Services</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The EC says Apple prevented the developers of music streaming services such as Spotify from informing <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/" >iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> users about alternatives and lower prices for music subscriptions available outside the App Store</p><p>“For a decade, Apple abused its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps through the App Store,” said Margrethe Vestager, the Commission’s executive vice president in charge of competition policy. “They did so by restricting developers from informing consumers about alternative, cheaper music services outside the Apple ecosystem. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules, so today we have fined Apple over €1.8 billion.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-apple-products-you-shouldnt-buy-this-month/" >The Apple products you shouldn’t buy this month <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Being the sole provider of the App Store for iOS users gives Apple control over all aspects of the iOS experience, and the EC found the company’s level of control to be outright restrictive and in violation of the European Union’s (EU) anti-steering provisions. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/the-app-store-spotify-and-europes-thriving-digital-music-market/" >Apple contradicted <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the EC’s decision, noting that Spotify met with the Commission more than 65 times during this investigation. Apple defended its App Store review process and commission structure, calling them fair and applicable equally to all developers. It noted that many services, including music streaming, can avoid commission fees by selling subscriptions outside the App Store.</p><p>According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/13/tech/spotify-apple-antitrust/index.html" >different sources <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Apple required Spotify and other music streaming app developers to pay up to a 30% commission fee on purchases made through Apple’s in-app payment system without allowing these developers to share information about subscription deals outside the App Store. </p><p>Apple, however, stressed that Spotify does not pay Apple any commission despite utilizing the App Store’s infrastructure because it acquires subscribers through its website. It also said 86% of the developers participating in its App Store never pay Apple a commission.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-update-apps-in-macos-two-options/" >How to update apps in MacOS: Two options <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The EC’s fine charges that Apple failed to inform iOS users within their apps about lower prices of subscription offers available on the internet outside of the app and price differences between in-app subscriptions sold through Apple’s in-app purchase mechanism and those available elsewhere.</p><p>The EC says that Apple also prohibited developers like Spotify from including links in their apps that would lead iOS users to the app developer’s website on which alternative subscriptions can be purchased. </p><p>“App developers were also prevented from contacting their own newly acquired users, for instance by email, to inform them about alternative pricing options after they set up an account,” the EC’s document notes. </p><p>Apple contends that the EC’s decision is ungrounded, arguing there is no evidence of consumer harm or anti-competitive behavior. <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/the-app-store-spotify-and-europes-thriving-digital-music-market/" >The company released a statement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> emphasizing its contributions to the European economy and the digital music market’s growth, challenging the EC’s findings with signals of an appeal.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apples-vision-pro-price-features-hands-on-insights-and-everything-you-need-to-know/" >What is Apple’s Vision Pro?

The DMA has already forced Apple to allow app sideloading in the EU to prevent some of the issues outlined in the EC’s fine, as it aims to diminish the market control these gatekeepers have in the EU.</p><h4 id="Apple"><a href="#Apple" class="headerlink" title="Apple"></a>Apple</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-hands-on/"  title="iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you&#39;ll get">iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you’ll get <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ios-18-settings-i-changed-immediately-and-why-you-should-too/"  title="6 iOS 18 settings I changed immediately -

However, the big question remains: can ChatGPT truly make a difference in patient care and treatments?</p><p> With ChatGPT, healthcare providers can organize patient data, translate medical terminology, and manage information efficiently. But, before using it, you must ensure it is absolutely safe for handling people’s precious health.</p><h2 id="What-Is-the-Role-of-ChatGPT-in-Public-Health"><a href="#What-Is-the-Role-of-ChatGPT-in-Public-Health" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Role of ChatGPT in Public Health?"></a>What Is the Role of ChatGPT in Public Health?</h2><p> NLP (Natural Language Processing) is not a brand-new concept in the healthcare sector. The industry has been using systems similar to—though not as user-friendly as—ChatGPT for a while to handle the vast amount of data they deal with daily.</p><p> However, NLP systems are used by healthcare professionals, not patients. Medical professionals use these systems, whether custom-made or from third-party providers, for tasks like organizing medical documents and conducting research with data.</p><p> ChatGPT is also an NLP tool, but it’s not your ordinary chatbot—it is quite advanced, and various industries have already embraced it to make their work seamless and solve tricky challenges.</p><p> What makes ChatGPT special is that it is simpler, user-friendly, and can have human-like conversations. Although both ChatGPT and existing NLP systems in healthcare are not perfect, they can help meet the growing demands of patient care worldwide.

It can do many things to make their lives easier, like handling paperwork, checklists, and logs. In a recent survey by<a class="link"   href="https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/nursing/nurses-say-distractions-cut-bedside-time-25" >Jackson Healthcare <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , most nurses admitted spending 25% of their shift on non-patient tasks, and ChatGPT aims to reduce that burden.</p><h3 id="Using-ChatGPT-to-Sort-Unstructured-Data"><a href="#Using-ChatGPT-to-Sort-Unstructured-Data" class="headerlink" title="Using ChatGPT to Sort Unstructured Data"></a>Using ChatGPT to Sort Unstructured Data</h3><p> Unstructured data in the medical field includes things like clinical notes, patient feedback, and medical literature. While you can read it, it becomes hard to search once it piles up in hundreds of documents saved by doctors. As a result, you can’t get valuable insights from this data, which is crucial for diagnosis and medical care.</p><p> ChatGPT can quickly analyze massive amounts of data—even diagnostics data. Just ask it a specific question with the sorting criteria you need, and it will give you the structured data you are looking for. You can copy its response, save it on a notepad, and open the file in Microsoft Excel to finish the process—problem solved!</p><h3 id="Remote-Patient-Monitoring-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#Remote-Patient-Monitoring-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Remote Patient Monitoring With ChatGPT"></a>Remote Patient Monitoring With ChatGPT</h3><p> Even though doctors can’t be with their patients all the time, patients need to keep track of their symptoms. This is where remote patient monitoring comes in. Patients track vital signs—like blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose levels—and share this data with their doctor. The doctor then reviews the information and provides feedback to the patient. It’s a way to stay connected and care for patient health even when not in the same place.</p><p> But clinicians receive a lot of vital signs data from patients every single day, which can be overwhelming to examine. Luckily, ChatGPT can analyze the information collected by home health monitoring systems and provide clear insights for both patients and healthcare professionals. All patients have to do is share their results, and ChatGPT will let them know if everything is normal or not.
