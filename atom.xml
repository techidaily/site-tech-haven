Just like iPhones and cases, Apple Watches can be upgraded and customized for many situations, from casual to dressy, thanks to their interchangeable watch bands. </p><p>I’ve been an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> user for a few years now, and I recently upgraded from a Series 3 watch to the latest <a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-SE-2nd-Gen-GPS-40mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-Sport-Band-S-M-Fitness-Sleep-Tracker-Crash-Detection-Heart-Rate-Monitor/5033741510?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Watch SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Over the last several months, I’ve embarked on a journey to test Apple Watch bands from brands like Apple, Nomad, Spigen, and more, to find the best watch bands made of materials ranging from stainless steel to fabric to leather. I’ve also included input from other ZDNET experts who frequently try different watch bands and switch up their looks and consulted staff and customer reviews for bands across the market. Every pick on this list is backed by hands-on testing  staff. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/"><strong>The best Apple Watches you can buy</strong></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c1yHj02oP3w?si=mwi3FyP0p68gkBqV&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What’s-the-best-Apple-Watch-band-right-now"><a href="#What’s-the-best-Apple-Watch-band-right-now" class="headerlink" title="What’s the best Apple Watch band right now?"></a>What’s the best Apple Watch band right now?</h2><p>After months of wearing different bands during my daily activities and considering the rest of the ZDNET staff’s extensive hands-on analysis of watch bands, my pick for the best Apple Watch band overall is <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-band-black" >Nomad’s Sport Band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> thanks to its comfortable and breathable wear and its numerous color choices, including limited edition drops, for a nice upgrade over the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWMR3AM/A/41mm-soft-mint-sport-band-s-m?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >plain sports band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that came with my Apple Watch.</p><p>Not looking for a sport band pick?

It is designed for intense workouts and everyday wear. Plus, it’s 100% waterproof, so you can wear it as you exercise in rain, sleet, or snow without worrying about damage. Its lightweight design that encourages ventilation has also solved my sweaty gym wrists (if you know, you know). </p><p>If you’re looking to purchase a sport band or you love Nomad’s bands, we recommend keeping an eye on their website because the company regularly offers Limited Edition models with cool colors and styles (including the one pictured above on my Apple Watch SE). These historically sell out quickly, so if you see a limited edition offering, it’s smart to make your purchase quickly.</p><p>I tested the Nomad Sport band in the limited edition glow-in-the-dark Glow 2.0 design, and I was impressed with how similar it felt and performed to my original Apple sport band. Although not every sport band features this fun glow, they all offer the same features. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nomads-glow-in-the-dark-iphone-case-just-sold-out-but-its-alternatives-are-just-as-good/"><strong>Nomad’s glow-in-the-dark iPhone case just sold out, but its alternatives are just as good</strong></a></p><p>When I tested the Nomad sport band, I liked the durable yet comfortable material, the numerous color options available, the customizable adjustability, and the overall look of the band. Getting the band initially secured was a little difficult, but over time, I got it on and off quickly. It’s a nice upgrade from the standard Apple band, and should work for most people. Since it offers more notch options, it felt more secure on my wrist than the Apple sport band, and I felt it stayed cleaner than my Apple band typically does. </p><p>I only have two issues with this band. The first is that after a few weeks of wear, the coating on the stainless steel pin started coming off, although it isn’t noticeable unless I look very closely. Secondly, despite the numerous color options, I wish Nomad offered more, like some softer pastels.</p><p>Nomad sport band customers on <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16ldce5/are%5Fnomad%5Fstraps%5Fany%5Fgood/" >Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> said they liked the quality, color options (including limited edition designs), and overall value of the band. Some customers said the band did not sit flush with the Apple Watch Ultra, and one customer said the stainless steel pin broke off their band (although they reported customer service promptly replaced their purchase). </p><p><strong>Nomad Sport Band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Fluoroelastomer rubber | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch Ultra, Series 9, 8, 7, 6, SE, and all previous versions of Apple Watch | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 45mm&#x2F;49mm or 40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://burga.sjv.io/c/159047/1270603/15631?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%253A%252F%252Fus.burga.com%252Fproducts%252Fall-eyes-on-me-apple-watch-band&subId1=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp" >View now at Burga <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Two-tone design</li><li>Similar feel to jewelry watch</li><li>Clasp closure</li><li>Affordable luxury</li><li>Adjustable</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Clasp can sometimes clip skin</li><li>Requires careful wear&#x2F;proper care</li></ul><h2 id="Burga-Stainless-Steel-Two-Tone-Apple-Watch-Band"><a href="#Burga-Stainless-Steel-Two-Tone-Apple-Watch-Band" class="headerlink" title="Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch Band"></a>Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch Band</h2><h3 id="Best-metal-Apple-Watch-band-for-style"><a href="#Best-metal-Apple-Watch-band-for-style" class="headerlink" title="Best metal Apple Watch band for style"></a>Best metal Apple Watch band for style</h3><p>Since I began exploring Apple watch bands, I’ve been searching for one that I can use to dress up my everyday look. This Burga watch band offers a two-tone stainless steel strap and an easy clasp closure. The inside is designed for comfort, and the band can support everyday wear and tear.</p><p>When I tested this Burga watch over a few weeks, I was immediately impressed with its overall appearance. It looked expensive and of quality, echoing the same look as a non-smart watch. It has a nice weight, and it was easy to follow the adjustment instructions to fit it to my wrist. </p><p>Throughout testing, I received several compliments on this band – which doesn’t often happen despite the number of products I test through my work, and I was happy with the affordable luxury look it gave my Watch SE. I had no issues with tarnishing or chipping after my few weeks of wear, although I was careful around water, did not wear the band while applying lotion, makeup, or perfume, and used a jewelry cloth to wipe it down every few wears or so. I also did not wear this band during intense workouts, but it was fine during my casual walks, usually 3-5 miles daily. </p><p>With proper care, this watch band offers great value. It looks much more expensive than it is, and it is worth the money if you’re looking to switch up your look for a special occasion or a few times a week. It is slightly pricier than bands made of less expensive materials but significantly less expensive than titanium options. </p><p>Current Burga customers said they liked this watch band’s overall design and quality, with some saying it looks and feels like an affordable luxury. </p><p><strong>Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Stainless steel | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> No | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> All current Apple Watch models | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 42mm&#x2F;44mm&#x2F;45mm&#x2F;49mm or 38mm&#x2F;40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-slim-band-white-41mm" >View now at Nomad Goods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Durable</li><li>High quality</li><li>Interior ventilation</li><li>Slim profile</li><li>Good for small wrists</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Limited color options</li><li>Slight wear on stainless steel pin</li><li>A little pricey</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kTHQrw8e1gk?si=gTPIa7KjhSZ0Vz97&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Nomad-Slim-Sport-Band"><a href="#Nomad-Slim-Sport-Band" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Slim Sport Band"></a>Nomad Slim Sport Band</h2><h3 id="Best-slim-everyday-Apple-Watch-band"><a href="#Best-slim-everyday-Apple-Watch-band" class="headerlink" title="Best slim everyday Apple Watch band"></a>Best slim everyday Apple Watch band</h3><p>Nomad’s slim sport band is a thinner version of the brand’s sport band. Though it features a similar design, material, and overall feel, the slim band has a thinner construction and a smaller overall look on the wearer’s wrist. </p><p>Like the classic sport band, the slim band is 100% waterproof, features a lightweight design that encourages ventilation, and is made of the same durable material. I was able to test the slim sport band for several weeks with my Apple Watch SE in starlight, and I liked how similar in color and feel it was to the Apple-issue sport band that came with my watch. </p><p>When I tested the band, I was also impressed with how secure the stainless steel pin kept the watch despite its more delicate profile. I prefer the slim band over Nomad’s classic sport band for everyday wear, though I can understand why this style may not be the best for someone with larger wrists or a desire for a more prominent watch band. </p><p>Like the sport band, it was a little tough to put on at first, but it became easier to do so the more I wore it. I have also seen some chipping on the stainless steel pin’s coating, and like with the sport band, I wish there were more color options. Since the slim band is my preferred style, it’s a bit of a disappointment that there are only four color options, especially when the larger sport band has quite a bit more and limited edition offerings. I’d love to see more punchy colors and some soft pastels in the slim band – it’s a great option for often smaller women’s wrists. </p><p>Regardless of my feelings about the color selection, I enjoyed testing the slim band, and since then, I’ve been frequently wearing it in my daily activities. </p><p><strong>Nomad Slim Sport Band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Fluoroelastomer rubber | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch Ultra, Series 9, 8, 7, 6, SE, and all previous versions of Apple Watch <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 45mm&#x2F;49mm or 40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.spigen.com/products/apple-watch-series-band-liquid-crystal-pro" >View now at Spigen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Crytal-Designed-Crystal/dp/B098SX92FT?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cce24ac5f-8b85-47ba-949f-92aa609a9e56%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Truly clear</li><li>Case and band combo</li><li>Easy to take on and off</li><li>Easy to insert watch</li><li>Affordable</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Needs breaking in</li><li>Silicone not the most malleable</li></ul><h2 id="Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Pro-Apple-Watch-Case-and-Band"><a href="#Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Pro-Apple-Watch-Case-and-Band" class="headerlink" title="Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch Case and Band"></a>Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch Case and Band</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kx-Pb0otJCs?si=Mvr49yQVesmJA8-O&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-clear-Apple-Watch-case-and-band"><a href="#Best-clear-Apple-Watch-case-and-band" class="headerlink" title="Best clear Apple Watch case and band"></a>Best clear Apple Watch case and band</h3><p>Spigen’s Liquid Proband is both an Apple watch strap and a case in one. Simply pop in your Apple Watch and fasten it to your wrist – you don’t have to deal with sliding any bands in. The Liquid Pro is available in crystal clear and black space clear colors. </p><p>It is made of soft silicone for comfort, fastens with a traditional buckle, and features a unibody design. I wasn’t expecting to like this band and case combo as much as I did. While I don’t think I’d consider this for myself for everyday wear, this is a great option for kids thanks to its all-in-one approach or for those looking to minimize the appearance of their watch thanks to the crystal clear design. </p><p>When I tested this watch band over a few months, I liked how easy it was to pop my watch in and out of this case yet how secure it remained. I also liked that the built-in case provided extra protection around my watch. The watch band itself is pretty comfortable overall, though the silicone wasn’t extremely malleable and is still a bit stiff. I predict that over more daily wear, it will eventually contour more to one’s wrist, but it definitely needs breaking in. </p><p><strong>Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Silicone | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 40mm&#x2F;44mm&#x2F;45mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://www.nike.com/w/apple-watch-nike-sport-band-7dq6d" >View now at Nike <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUV53AM/A/45mm-midnight-sky-nike-sport-band-m-l&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Comfortable</li><li>Breathes well</li><li>Durable</li><li>Fun colors</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Dust and residue collect in the holes</li><li>Requires cleaning</li></ul><h2 id="Nike-Apple-Watch-Sport-Band"><a href="#Nike-Apple-Watch-Sport-Band" class="headerlink" title="Nike Apple Watch Sport Band"></a>Nike Apple Watch Sport Band</h2><h3 id="Best-classic-Apple-Watch-band-alternative"><a href="#Best-classic-Apple-Watch-band-alternative" class="headerlink" title="Best classic Apple Watch band alternative"></a>Best classic Apple Watch band alternative</h3><p>Nike’s flagship sports band is the athletic brand’s take on the classic Apple sports band. With a similar overall design and thickness, the Nike band deviates in its ventilation and color options. You can wear it while training, cooking, or cleaning around the house. </p><p>The band features six colors with flecks randomly strewn across. For added breathability, compression-molded perforations (a.k.a. small holes across the band) keep it durable, lightweight, strong, and soft. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-review/"><strong>Apple Watch Series 9</strong></a></p><p>ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner tested the Nike band on the Apple Watch Series 9 when it first launched and said he was impressed with how the watch remained secure during intense workouts without squeezing his wrist too much. However, one potential issue for some is that the numerous holes can collect dust and dirt, which could take some time to clean. </p><p>Verified customers from Best Buy said they liked the Nike sport band’s overall value, quality, and ease of use. They also said they liked the multicolor options and built-in ventilation. </p><p><strong>Nike Sport Band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Fluoroelastomer rubber | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch models 41mm &#x2F; 45mm (can also find 38mm, 40mm) | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> fit S&#x2F;M (130-180mm) and M&#x2F;L (150-200mm)</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://zulualphastraps.com/products/apple-strap" >View now at Zulu Alpha Straps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Handmade in the UK</li><li>Ships worldwide</li><li>Company makes straps in custom lengths</li><li>Multiple color options</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Must pay shipping to US</li><li>A bit pricey</li></ul><h2 id="Zulu-Alpha-Apple-Watch-Strap"><a href="#Zulu-Alpha-Apple-Watch-Strap" class="headerlink" title="Zulu Alpha Apple Watch Strap"></a>Zulu Alpha Apple Watch Strap</h2><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-band-for-custom-lengths-and-rugged-wear"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-band-for-custom-lengths-and-rugged-wear" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch band for custom lengths and rugged wear"></a>Best Apple Watch band for custom lengths and rugged wear</h3><p>If you’re looking for a super adjustable yet comfortable Apple Watch band option for more rugged wear, the Zulu Alpha strap may suit you. Handmade in the UK and designed for comfort in challenging environments, the Zulu Alpha Apple Strap features tubular bonded polyester webbing, which withstands abrasions better than nylon does. The material also dries more quickly, so you can wear your watch with less downtime or more comfortably if it gets wet while on your wrist. Metal connectors, which you can choose in steel or black, are sewn into the straps for a perfect fit.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-search-for-the-ultimate-apple-watch-ultra-strap-is-over/"><strong>My search for the ultimate Apple Watch Ultra strap is over</strong></a></p><p>ZDNET contributor Adrian Kingsley-Hughes tested this band with his <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch-ultra-strap/" >Apple Watch Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and said he liked the strong stitching, the tri-glide buckle that fastens with ease, and the overall comfort. “This is a strap that will no doubt outlast the Apple Watch Ultra itself,” he said in his review. </p><p>What’s even better? The strap is made to order and made by hand, taking around 1.5 hours to complete. Before shipping to you, three pairs of hands evaluate the Alpha strap. These straps aren’t mass-produced or gathering dust on a shelf before they reach your door. Instead, they’re carefully crafted with high-quality materials to sustain your rugged adventures. </p><p><strong>Zulu Alpha strap features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Tubular bonded polyester webbing | <strong>Thickness:</strong> 1.2mm | <strong>Width:</strong> 22mm | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> All Apple Watches | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 38mm &#x2F; 40mm &#x2F; 41mm or 42mm &#x2F; 44mm &#x2F; 45mm &#x2F; 49mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-band"><a href="#What-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-band" class="headerlink" title="What is the best Apple Watch band?"></a>What is the best Apple Watch band?</h2><p>The best Apple Watch band for your lifestyle will ultimately be a uniquely personal decision, often depending on the occasion and use case.

Often, Apple Watch bands from third-party brands are sized according to the display size of your watch, such as 40mm, 45mm, 49mm, etc, but they are not necessarily your watch model. Some bands may also have wrist-size options, such as Apple’s flagship sport bands, which are S&#x2F;M and M&#x2F;L, but other options don’t specify wrist sizes (they ensure adjustability for a great fit). Be sure you know what band size and potentially what wrist size you need.</li><li><strong>Durability</strong>: A purchase is hardly worth it if your Apple Watch band breaks or cracks, so it’s important to consider the long-term durability while searching for watch bands. We don’t want you to waste your cash on cheap options, so we’ve tested the picks on this list before recommending them.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: As with other purchases, what you’re willing to spend is critical. Establishing a budget can help narrow down your search parameters and ensure you’re purchasing within your comfort range. Keep in mind that the material will often drive the cost of Apple Watch bands up. Several metal band options on this list, particularly the titanium options, are over $100.</li><li><strong>Comfort:</strong> If you’re purchasing a watch band, you might want it to be comfortable. When I tested watch bands over the last several months, I considered comfort on my own wrist before recommending anything on this list. Your watch band must be secure, too, especially if you’re using your watch during intense workouts or for heart rate monitoring.</li></ul><h2 id="How-did-we-test-these-best-Apple-Watch-bands"><a href="#How-did-we-test-these-best-Apple-Watch-bands" class="headerlink" title="How did we test these best Apple Watch bands?"></a>How did we test these best Apple Watch bands?</h2><p>We went hands-on with every Apple Watch band on this list before selecting and recommending our picks. I conducted hands-on testing over several months on over a dozen watch bands and incorporated even more analysis and hands-on testing  staff. </p><p>We spent time wearing these bands in our day-to-day lives, during work, errands, workouts, and more to get a feel for each band’s comfort, security, adjustability, and more – not just for a day or two, but over the course of a few weeks to really get a feel for each product’s add-in value. Can you “add” this product into your life and benefit from its presence, or is it just another fad product that’s too good to be true or collects dust after the buzz wears off? </p><p>If we think another product is worth your money, we’ll update this list or write up a spotlight review highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it’s for. </p><p>Plus, we routinely scour the web for new products worthy of testing, follow news on product rollouts and upgrades, and source the best deals. We know buying anything in the current economy is not just for your whims, and that’s why this list, as well as our other advice, is tailored to your needs, wants, and budget. Our picks are expert-tested and expert-vetted. </p><h2 id="How-do-I-know-what-size-Apple-Watch-band-to-buy"><a href="#How-do-I-know-what-size-Apple-Watch-band-to-buy" class="headerlink" title="How do I know what size Apple Watch band to buy?"></a>How do I know what size Apple Watch band to buy?</h2><p>Before buying the best Apple Watch band for your Apple Watch, you need to know which size to buy. If you are not sure, Apple provides a convenient <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/shop/Catalog/US/Images/bxxd/size-guide%5FCA.pdf" >sizing template <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you can use to check sizing. However, most bands today from non-Apple brands are adjustable and customizable for fit, so the band size isn’t of consideration. I only needed to remove links for the metal options I tested the last few months – for every other band option, I could self-adjust easily. </p><p>The most important factor is to confirm that your Apple Watch works with your chosen band to ensure a seamless fit when putting the two together. This means if you have a 49mm watch, you want to look for a band that specifies that size. Essentially, just know what model and display size you purchased for your watch, and you’ll be okay. </p><h2 id="How-much-do-the-best-Apple-Watch-bands-cost"><a href="#How-much-do-the-best-Apple-Watch-bands-cost" class="headerlink" title="How much do the best Apple Watch bands cost?"></a>How much do the best Apple Watch bands cost?</h2><p>The cost of Apple Watch bands can run the gamut, ranging from around $30 to upwards of hundreds of dollars. Many metal bands can easily bring you into the hundreds – Nomad’s titanium band is a whopping $300, and iterations of Apple’s Milanese Loop can get pricey, too. However, most of the picks on this list are under $100 and sit comfortably between the $30-$80 range.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uV3vm805eX0?si=YSPcsFxBcJmoxLsU&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-the-different-Apple-Watch-bands-available-from-Apple"><a href="#What-are-the-different-Apple-Watch-bands-available-from-Apple" class="headerlink" title="What are the different Apple Watch bands available from Apple?"></a>What are the different Apple Watch bands available from Apple?</h2><p>Apple offers several band options that are included with its watches, some dependent on the model purchased.

In fact, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently awarded the status of medical device development tool (MDDT) to the Apple Watch’s atrial fibrillation (AFib) history tracker.

The Nomad titanium band is ZDNET contributor Matthew Miller’s favorite Apple Watch Ultra band. Miller says it “has a gorgeous, lightweight design, comes with a flawless magnetic clasp, and is less expensive than Apple’s metal band.” It comes in two sizes and two colors (natural and black).

Despite the size, these devices still offer big battery lives, vibrant displays, impressive cameras, and plenty of customizable features for ease of use, no matter what you need a small tablet for. </p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XS1nQCe95LU?si=A2dhdFkSAI61_nKA&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-the-best-small-tablet-right-now"><a href="#What-is-the-best-small-tablet-right-now" class="headerlink" title="What is the best small tablet right now?"></a>What is the best small tablet right now?</h2><p>Based on our extensive hands-on testing with various tablets of all sizes, our pick for the best small tablet is the <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FW785?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C93180b5c-bf54-4db2-9a2c-7fb7997a02bb%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >iPad Mini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, thanks to its 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display and weight of just under 1 pound.

The iPad Mini was last updated in the fall of 2021 with new features like support for the second-gen Apple Pencil, a slightly bigger screen size, and a USB-C port for charging and data transfer.</p><p>There’s a spot on the right side of the tablet to charge the Apple Pencil, making it a great tablet for drawing or writing notes. Customers who bought the iPad Mini reported in reviews that they were impressed by its battery life, durability, and display. They also noted its portability to fit in purses and bags, particularly for entertainment purposes. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-6th-generation-tablet-64-gb-8-3-mk7p3lla/"><strong>Apple iPad Mini (6th Gen.)</strong></a></p><p>ZDNET Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner tested the iPad Mini and said that it “feels more like an [oversized] smartphone than a small tablet at times.”</p><p>“It can easily slip into bags, purses, and even the pockets of some cargo pants and vests,” he wrote. “Compared to a phone, it’s better for reading ebooks, PDFs, documents, news apps, and other digital content – especially when leaning back in a chair or a couch.”</p><p>Of course, you’ll also get iPadOS 16 with features like shared tab groups, Stage Manager, and external display support if you ever need to see something on a bigger screen. Ultimately, you get all these things for less than what you would pay for an iPad Air or an iPad Pro. </p><p><strong>iPad Mini tech specs: Display</strong>: 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display | <strong>Processor</strong>: A15 Bionic | <strong>Storage</strong>: 64GB or 256GB | <strong>Colors</strong>: Space gray, pink, purple, starlight | <strong>Cameras</strong>: 8MP rear, 1080p video. 12MP FaceTime camera with Center Stage | <strong>Weight</strong>: 0.65 pounds | <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 7.69 x 5.3 x 0.25 inches | <strong>Connections</strong>: USB-C | <strong>Battery life:</strong> 10 hours</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Tablet/dp/B096WKKK2K?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C93180b5c-bf54-4db2-9a2c-7fb7997a02bb%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amazon-fire-7-2022-7-tablet-with-wi-fi-16-gb-black/6508109.p?skuId=6508109&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Good battery life</li><li>Can double as an Alexa smart display</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Performance is slightly slow</li><li>Cameras aren’t as great as other options</li></ul><h2 id="Amazon-Fire-7-Tablet"><a href="#Amazon-Fire-7-Tablet" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Fire 7 Tablet"></a>Amazon Fire 7 Tablet</h2><h3 id="Best-budget-small-tablet"><a href="#Best-budget-small-tablet" class="headerlink" title="Best budget small tablet"></a>Best budget small tablet</h3><p>If you’re looking for something even smaller and cheaper than the iPad Mini, the Amazon Fire 7 tablet is a great budget tablet pick. The Fire tablet’s 7-inch screen has a 1024 x 600 display, so you can stream movies or play video games without hauling around a bulky tablet. </p><p>Former ZDNET contributor Jason Cipriani reviewed the Amazon Fire 7 tablet and said it offers “a well-rounded experience as long as you take the cost into account when setting expectations.” Even though performance may be a bit slow, Cipriani said that’s expected at a price point like $60, considering the tablet is a colorful Kindle, a dedicated Alexa smart display, and a smart home controller, all in one device.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-fire-7-2022-review/"><strong>Amazon Fire 7 (2022)</strong></a></p><p>Along with the ability to ask Alexa questions, you can view and manage your Alexa-connected smart home devices. You can control cameras, lights, and outlets using your voice or by tapping the dedicated Devices button in the bottom navigation bar. </p><p>Overall, 90% of Best Buy customers who bought the Amazon Fire 7 tablet would recommend it to a friend, giving it an average rating of 4.5 out of 5.</p><p><strong>Amazon Fire 7 tech specs: Display</strong>: 7-inch, 1024x600 display | <strong>Processor</strong>: MediaTek MT8168V&#x2F;B | <strong>Storage</strong>: 16GB or 326GB | <strong>Colors</strong>: Black, denim, or rose | <strong>Cameras</strong>: 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording| <strong>Weight</strong>: 9.9 ounces | <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 7.11 x 4.63 x 0.38 inches | <strong>Connections</strong>: 2 USB-C, 3.5mm jack | <strong>Battery life:</strong> 10 hours</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1773404-REG/boox%5Ftab%5Fmini%5Fc%5F7%5F8%5Fe%5Fink%5Ftablet.html/BI/23252/KBID/28790/SID/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp" >View now at B&amp;H Photo-Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Long lasting battery life</li><li>Gorgeous design and display</li><li>Great templates for taking notes</li><li>Easy reading</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Some complaints of lag</li></ul><h2 id="Boox-Tab-Mini-C"><a href="#Boox-Tab-Mini-C" class="headerlink" title="Boox Tab Mini C"></a>Boox Tab Mini C</h2><h3 id="Best-small-tablet-for-note-taking"><a href="#Best-small-tablet-for-note-taking" class="headerlink" title="Best small tablet for note-taking"></a>Best small tablet for note-taking</h3><p>Boox is an e-reader and drawing tablet with a vivid color display, so your e-book’s illustrations will pop as you read, and so will your color-coordinated notes. Speaking of which, the note-taking templates on the Tab Mini C are handy. Whether you’re a student taking Cornell-style notes, a desk job employee making an hourly plan for your day, a musician crafting a piece of sheet music, or a historian drafting a timeline, the Tab Mini C offers a template for that. </p><p>Another fun feature is the tablet’s four customizable refresh modes. These modes are helpful for streaming videos on YouTube and needing a smoother display or for e-reading and not minding a clunkier refresh. With adjustable warm and cool lights, you can customize your desired blue light level to tone the display before bedtime for an easier-on-the-eyes reading experience. </p><p>ZDNET editor Nina Raemont, who contributed to this article, has been using the tablet to manage her work-life calendar, build lists for grocery shopping, meeting agendas, and more. It’s become Raemont’s deskside companion and staple note-taking device. Because of its lightweight and effortless portability, it has replaced the trusty Moleskin notebook she avidly used to plan her day. </p><p>The robust battery life lasts many days to a week or two, and the tablet comes with a magnetically attached stylus with pressure detection for drawing. The tablet’s sleek design has a minimalist feel and careful use of popping colors.

The previous generation weighed 6.1 ounces, but this new one weighs only 5.56 ounces, and it’s drastically easier to carry and hold than an actual book (especially those thick hardcovers). </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-new-kindle-has-officially-converted-me-to-e-readers/"><strong>Amazon Kindle (11th generation)</strong></a></p><p>Its 300ppi display is the same as that of the Kindle Paperwhite and the Kindle Oasis. The anti-glare display makes it easy to read in any light, and dark mode is a warm welcome when you’re trying to read at night without letting blue light interrupt your sleep cycle. </p><p>I went hands-on with this Kindle and was impressed by the quickly loading pages, the exceptional backlight, and the long-lasting battery life, which was at about 70% after one week of frequent use. I almost exclusively read on my Kindle and have retired my hardcover book habit. </p><p><strong>Amazon Kindle tech specs: Display:</strong> 6-inch, 300ppi glare-free | <strong>Storage:</strong> 16GB | <strong>Colors:</strong> Black or denim | <strong>Weight:</strong> 5.56 ounces | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches | <strong>Connections:</strong> USB-C | <strong>Battery</strong>: Up to six weeks</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/157381628&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Expandable storage</li><li>Low price point</li><li>Long-lasting battery</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Performance could be better</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OxkndZbIA4?si=TWJlkTbYKsVag8-q&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-A7-Lite"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-A7-Lite" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite"></a>Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite</h2><h3 id="Best-Samsung-small-tablet"><a href="#Best-Samsung-small-tablet" class="headerlink" title="Best Samsung small tablet"></a>Best Samsung small tablet</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-samsung-tablet/" >Samsung’s tablet lineup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> spans price, capability, and screen size. The Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is a small Android tablet that combines affordability and usefulness. Its 8.7-inch screen features a 1340x800 display, making it worthy of streaming, working, and more.</p><p>The lightweight design and small display make the Tab A7 Lite portable enough to take anywhere, especially if you’re using it to entertain kids with educational apps. Plus, the metal frame adds some added ruggedness.</p><p>In addition, you can expand your storage beyond the 32GB or 64GB allotted. The tablet allows up to 1TB of expandable storage, twice as much as the previous model.

We also looked at a tablet’s weight to ensure they were portable.</li><li><strong>Display:</strong> Small tablets shouldn’t have to compromise on an already smaller display, so we also considered display resolution.</li><li><strong>Battery life:</strong> A device’s battery life is important no matter its size, so we considered devices that can last you all day.</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> Tablets vary in price range from affordable to expensive depending on brand and purpose, so we made sure to choose tablets at various price points to accommodate different budgets.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BmegThMdrJE?si=rILo1FJb9DgnPljV&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-we-test-tablets"><a href="#How-we-test-tablets" class="headerlink" title="How we test tablets"></a>How we test tablets</h2><p>The ZDNET team chose all of the tablets included in this list based on their performance when <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tested in the real world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.</p><ul><li><strong>Display</strong>: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy.<br>We also compare the display’s performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen’s responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer’s stylus.</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet’s temperature during intensive tasks.</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong>: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.</li><li><strong>Camera and audio:</strong> For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.</li></ul><p>For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tablet testing methodology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><h2 id="What-is-the-smallest-tablet-screen-size"><a href="#What-is-the-smallest-tablet-screen-size" class="headerlink" title="What is the smallest tablet screen size?"></a>What is the smallest tablet screen size?</h2><p>The smallest tablet screen size on the market is 6 to 7 inches. Anything smaller would be more similar to a smartphone.</p><p>It’s why you want to consider your primary uses when considering which small tablet is right for you. To demonstrate, if you travel often, one with a smaller screen will be perfect for carrying&#x2F;using on an airplane. If your aim is to read more e-books or draw, you’ll want one with a larger screen. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJNYTGHVlLc?si=lhdUUVYMVQjzHXBh&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-brand-of-tablet-is-best"><a href="#What-brand-of-tablet-is-best" class="headerlink" title="What brand of tablet is best?"></a>What brand of tablet is best?</h2><p>Tablets made by Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft are the best-made tablets in terms of quality. Amazon has well-rounded tablets in its Fire lineup but with fewer performance-focused features. Boox is also proving to be an industry underdog, with impressive tablets that function as e-readers and illustrators. </p><p>Keep in mind in certain cases (Apple, Samsung), you can pair your other devices with the tablet. In the case of Apple tablets, you can log in using your Apple ID to access the same apps, pictures, and more from your phone on your iPad. </p><p>Meanwhile, with Samsung devices, you can implement Samsung Flow. Download the app on your phone and tablet.

With companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google already infusing their products with <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" >generative AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Apple is clearly behind in the race. Even if consumers aren’t longing for AI enhancements to all their usual apps and services, investors are anxiously waiting to see what the company can pull off in this new era of technology.</p><p>To catch up, Apple reportedly has been <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apples-ai-advances-could-make-or-break-the-iphone-16/" >working on its own in-house AI tech <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to add to the next-generation iPhone and other products.

Such features will require opt-in, meaning users must agree to use them before they work on background.</p><p>Apple has also allegedly been seeking a partner for outside help, possibly teaming up with <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-nears-deal-with-openai-to-power-upcoming-iphone-features-with-chatgpt-says-bloomberg/" >OpenAI to bring its chatbot expertise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to iOS and Google to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-is-in-talks-to-bring-googles-gemini-ai-models-to-the-iphone-as-early-as-this-year/" >bring Gemini-powered AI features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Just a few months ago, the company <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-latest-acquisition-hints-at-ai-powered-iphone-plans/" >purchased a Canadian startup firm called DarwinAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has designed ways to make AI systems smaller and more efficient.</p><p>More recently, rumors have suggested that some new AI features will include more intelligent and helpful searches in Safari, AI-generated emojis based on conversations in Messages, and an AI-powered <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-photos-app-is-getting-an-ai-powered-editing-feature-to-wipe-out-photobombers/" >photo editing app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> similar to Google’s Magic Eraser. It’s worth noting that such features are believed to only function on the more recent Apple products, including the iPhone 15 Pro with its A17 Pro chip and M-series iPads and MacBooks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LlVkEwpjKKo?si=hXi-mchMaJvbnIzM&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Don’t-forget-the-other-acronym-RCS"><a href="#2-Don’t-forget-the-other-acronym-RCS" class="headerlink" title="2.

I spent a good half hour looking for one before realizing that this charging station can accommodate both USB-A and USB-C flavors of the Apple Watch charging cable. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-keeps-selling-out-of-this-3-in-1-charging-cube-i-tested-one-to-see-if-its-worth-the-wait/"><strong>Apple keeps selling out of this 3-in-1 charging cube.

Too many nightstand charging stations are a Christmas tree of eye-piercing LED lights. A single button on this charging station turns off the LEDs and the fan, ensuring that you have a good night’s sleep. </p><p>As I said earlier, I’ve been using this charging station for several weeks now, and I’ve had no problem at all. The charger unit is sturdy and made very well, the magnets do a fine job of holding the iPhone and AirPods Pro in place, and the unit charges everything just as you’d expect. Oh, and night mode means you don’t have to try to sleep next to a pile of glowing LEDs. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-accessory/"><strong>The best

When it’s folded up, the pen rests against the Pro 8’s bottom bezel. It wirelessly charges the pen, so it’s constantly ready for use. </p><p>Overall, I love the design of the Pro 8. I’ve actually found myself using it as a tablet more than I do the iPad Pro simply because the kickstand is built into the housing. There isn’t another cover or case I have to manage.

Again, those prices don’t include a keyboard. </p><h3 id="More-Microsoft"><a href="#More-Microsoft" class="headerlink" title="More Microsoft"></a>More Microsoft</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-windows-laptop/" >The best Windows laptop models: Comparing Dell, Samsung, Lenovo, and more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-microsoft-edge-settings-to-change-for-more-secure-browsing-than-chrome-offers/" >5 Microsoft Edge settings to change for more secure browsing than Chrome offers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-for-windows-pc/" >The best VPN for Windows: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-recover-deleted-files-in-windows-10-or-11/" >How to recover deleted files in Windows 10 or 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>The rest of the specs include Wi-Fi 6 support, Bluetooth 5.1, and up to 14 hours of battery life, down from 16 hours for the Wi-Fi only model. </p><p>One of the first things I did after setting up the Pro 8 was to enable the 120Hz refresh rate, bumping it up from the standard 60Hz. I’ve been able to notice a difference while scrolling or doing some casual gaming, but overall, I’m not sure it’s entirely needed on the Pro 8. Yes, it helps, but it also comes at a cost of battery life. </p><p>I’ve yet to get anywhere near the 14-hour estimate, even when only using the Pro 8 on Wi-Fi. However, the Pro 8’s battery has lasted as long as my iPad Pro’s battery, which is typically an 8-hour workday, give or take an hour. </p><p>One thing that surprised me after using the Pro X and iPad Pro and switching to the Pro 8 is the fact the Pro 8 still has a fan in it. I’m guessing the Pro 8 is so much thicker than the Pro X in order to make room for a cooling system. The fan isn’t terribly loud, but it does run a lot, especially when I have the Pro 8 connected to an external monitor. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>Speaking of which, I had the Pro 8 connected to a monitor for the majority of my testing. Thanks to the addition of Thunderbolt 4 support, I was able to use any of the Thunderbolt 4 ports I have on hand – including <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Thunderbolt-Display-Compatible-Delivery/dp/B09MG5GJQL/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C43f6bfac-c51b-41c3-b15b-dc9ce6532a25%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Belkin’s Pro Thunderbolt 4 Dock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has enough ports for my use. </p><p>The ability to connect a tablet to an external display and have it actually work how it’s supposed to is a huge boost for my productivity. I was able to have apps like Slack and iCloud email open on the Pro 8’s screen, while writing in iA Writer on the larger external monitor with multiple Edge tabs open. </p><p>When working on my iPad Pro connected to a monitor, whatever’s on the iPad’s screen is mirrored on the larger display. There are some apps that use Apple’s rudimentary API for external displays, but it’s not great. </p><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends-2"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends-2" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/" >The best iPads: Which model should you buy? Apple’s tablet lineup has a wide range of prices and capabilities.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Also, I have a lot of workarounds for completing certain tasks on the iPad. For instance, in order to publish content , I often have to remotely access my MacBook Pro and use Chrome in order to add images to a story, otherwise the content management system errors out. To be fair, that’s a Safari issue that also exists on the Mac. However, I can use the true version of Chrome on a Mac and not a skinned version of the WebKit rendering engine that Apple forces developers to use on the iPhone and iPad. That means Edge, Chrome, Brave, and the like are essentially all just skinned versions of Safari. </p><p>I realize that the Pro 8 is running a full-fledged operating system in Windows 11, whereas the iPad Pro is running a mobile-first operating system in iPadOS, but the devices are relatively the same size and target the same type of user. Even the prices are close enough that the comparison is warranted. </p><p>The total cost of the Surface Pro 8 with LTE, along with the Signature Keyboard Cover with Slim Pen is $2,128. The iPad Pro with 5G, 16GB of memory, 1TB of storage, Apple’s Magic Keyboard with trackpad and an Apple Pencil is $2,449. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2cXnI9oOvM?si=3nz2sBB124ln-83T&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="There-are-still-many-things-the-iPad-Pro-does-better"><a href="#There-are-still-many-things-the-iPad-Pro-does-better" class="headerlink" title="There are still many things the iPad Pro does better"></a>There are still many things the iPad Pro does better</h2><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>I admit, up until this point I’ve been writing what amounts to a love letter to the Surface Pro 8. But that’s because it truly deserves it. It’s a fantastic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-2-in-1-laptop/" >2-in-1 device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that I have thoroughly enjoyed using, but there are some areas where the iPad Pro is just a better device for me. </p><p>I prefer to use Apple’s Mail app along with my iCloud+ personal domain as opposed to either Thunderbird or the iCloud website for accessing my email. I also <em>love</em> writing on the iPad because there are far fewer distractions with a single app open and visible. I need to experiment more with using Windows apps in full screen and Focus assist to recreate a similar experience on Windows. It’s also a better tablet thanks to an interface that’s designed for touch-first. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/want-a-touchscreen-macbook-this-portable-monitor-makes-it-possible/"><strong>Want a touchscreen MacBook? This portable monitor makes it possible</strong></a></p><p>Another thing I love about my iPad Pro is that its performance is reliable and consistent. When using the Pro 8 with multiple apps open, there would be a slight delay or pause before an app would appear after being minimized at times. It wasn’t specific to any one app; I frequently experienced it with Thunderbird, Discord, and Slack. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaWcXdTn5SE?si=QbxEkX-4a17J5RVs&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bottom-line"><a href="#Bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom line"></a>Bottom line</h2><p>After a few months of the Surface Pro 8 sitting on a shelf, I have gone back to using it as my main device. I’m once again enjoying using multiple windows for multitasking, not having to worry about any extra workarounds, and I still have complete and total portability.</p><p>So, iPad or Surface Pro 8? With so much uncertainty over the future of iPadOS, I’m no longer as confident as I was once about the future of Apple’s high-end tablets. That said, Apple continues to make the best tablet-specific devices you can buy. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipados-16-1-stage-manager-multitasking-basics-how-to-use-the-new-ipad-feature/"><strong>iPadOS 16.1 Stage Manager multitasking basics</strong></a></p><p>If you’re on the fence about whether to go with the Surface Pro 8 or an iPad Pro, I’ll say this: you can’t go wrong with either device, as long as you know what you’re getting yourself into. The iPad Pro can do a lot of things, but only a few things really well. Whereas the Surface Pro 8 can do a lot of things really well, but it has its fair share of hiccups and gotchas as well.</p><p>At the end of the day, however, you’re getting a full computer in the Surface Pro 8 and, currently, 80% of one in the iPad Pro.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Kr7Dpw0HuM?si=05wWDXdPgmC-oBBE&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BR4gsW-J7as?si=9a56UDKZKhREZnwz&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-I-get-a-Surface-Pro-8-or-an-iPad-Pro"><a href="#Should-I-get-a-Surface-Pro-8-or-an-iPad-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Should I get a Surface Pro 8 or an iPad Pro?"></a>Should I get a Surface Pro 8 or an iPad Pro?</h2><p>If you’re on the fence about whether to go with the Surface Pro 8 or an iPad Pro, I’ll say this: you can’t go wrong with either device, as long as you know what you’re getting yourself into.

We’re well into trackpad and mouse support in iPadOS, and the iPad lineup has never looked or worked more like a laptop. However, with only a single port on the Pro and Air, connecting multiple accessories to the tablet can be a chore. For example, if you’re using the iPad with a USB keyboard, you have to disconnect the keyboard if you want to transfer some files to an external SSD. </p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/" >The best iPads: Which model should you buy?

You’re paying a premium for an Apple product, however. There are only three ports on the AV Multiport Adapter: HDMI, USB-A, and USB-C. </p><p>The USB-A port works with external hard drives or accessories, while the USB-C port only acts as a power pass-through for charging your iPad (or MacBook). The HDMI port supports up to 4K at 60Hz for all iPad models and a limited selection of MacBook models. </p><p>I included Apple’s hub in the list simply because, if you’ve owned a MacBook after Apple switched to USB-C, odds are you also have one of these adapters. I want to highlight that it does indeed work with the iPad Pro or Air, and it does a good job at providing minimal connections. </p><p>It’s expensive for what it offers, but that’s usually the case with Apple accessories.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Also supports some MacBook models</li><li>Works with hard drives or can provide power</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Only three ports</li></ul><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FF3BDW5?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C4dba75b4-d032-4653-961f-302d11837b53%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1676741-REG/caldigit%5F500916%5Fusb%5Fc%5Fsoho%5Fdock%5Fgen2.html/BI/23252/KBID/28790/SID/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp" >View now at B&amp;H Photo-Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gyGoQi7hsZk?si=8OcKcPUj2wSBmVZ1&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="CalDigit-USB-C-Soho-Dock"><a href="#CalDigit-USB-C-Soho-Dock" class="headerlink" title="CalDigit USB-C Soho Dock"></a>CalDigit USB-C Soho Dock</h2><h3 id="Best-for-multitasking"><a href="#Best-for-multitasking" class="headerlink" title="Best for multitasking"></a>Best for multitasking</h3><p>For $10 more than Apple’s adapter, you can get the CalDigit USB-C Soho Dock. With a total of eight ports, you can connect random accessories and devices to your iPad without having to figure out what to unplug. </p><p>The total list of ports includes 1 x USB-C (10Gb&#x2F;s) that connects the dock to your iPad. There’s another USB-C port next to a standard USB port, both of which offer 10Gb&#x2F;s speeds, a full-size SD card port, and a microSD card port. When it comes to external displays, you have an HDMI port and a DisplayPort with 4K@60Hz with HDR support. Next to the display connections is another USB-C port that only serves as a 100W PD receptacle to power all of your USB devices and charge the tablet or computer attached to the dock. </p><p>Instead of lengthy housing, the Soho has a rectangular design with ports on three of four sides. It’s a unique design since most hubs (like the aforementioned Anker) have a similar design. At $80, the Soho isn’t overpriced and offers a wide range of connections and speeds. </p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Plenty of port options</li><li>Unique design</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>A more costly option</li></ul><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S7LVDC9?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C4dba75b4-d032-4653-961f-302d11837b53%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="HyperDrive-Power-9-in-1"><a href="#HyperDrive-Power-9-in-1" class="headerlink" title="HyperDrive Power 9-in-1"></a>HyperDrive Power 9-in-1</h2><h3 id="Best-for-audio-output"><a href="#Best-for-audio-output" class="headerlink" title="Best for audio output"></a>Best for audio output</h3><p>The HyperDrive Power 9-in-1 hub is near the high-end of the docks on this list – but for good reason. With nine total ports and a lengthy USB-C cable that connects to the iPad, you can connect almost anything to the HyperDrive. </p><p>The ports include 1 x Gigabit Ethernet, 1 x 4K@30Hz, 1 x microSD, 1 x SD card reader, 3 x USB-A (5Gbps), 1 x USB-C PD at 60W, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. </p><p>The headphone jack may be confusing at first glance, and I’ll admit even I was perplexed by it. Then I remembered that, whenever you’re using a dock or hub with the iPad, it automatically routes all audio through the HDMI connection. By connecting a speaker or a pair of headphones to the audio jack on the Power hub, you’re able to listen to system sounds or music. </p><p>For someone who needs more than one or two USB ports – and prefers a hardwired Ethernet connection – the HyperDrive Power is where it’s at. </p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Provides a hardwired Ethernet connection</li><li>Nine total ports</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Headphone jack can be confusing</li><li>Most expensive option on our list</li></ul><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VYLQS9F/ref=asc_df_B08VYLQS9F1727002800000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B08VYLQS9F&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C4dba75b4-d032-4653-961f-302d11837b53%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nyp7-xVwqHA?si=XCuZbpKLFIdrGQQh&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TwelveSouth-HoverBar-Duo"><a href="#TwelveSouth-HoverBar-Duo" class="headerlink" title="TwelveSouth HoverBar Duo"></a>TwelveSouth HoverBar Duo</h2><h3 id="Best-ergonomic-display-option"><a href="#Best-ergonomic-display-option" class="headerlink" title="Best ergonomic display option"></a>Best ergonomic display option</h3><p>While the HoverBar Duo isn’t a hub, it’s included in this list because it provides a way to use the iPad that mimics a desktop feel. </p><p>I’ve used the HoverBar Duo with my 12.9-inch iPad Pro and all of the hubs discussed here.

It also features a 100W USB-C charging port to keep your mobile devices or even your laptop at full battery.</p><p>The TwelveSouth HoverBar Duo is an articulating arm that holds your iPad in either a vertical or horizontal position, allowing you to use it like you would a desktop monitor. It’s also a great option for more ergonomic digital art creation, since you can position your iPad to where it’s most comfortable to use.</p><h2 id="What-accessories-does-the-iPad-Pro-come-with"><a href="#What-accessories-does-the-iPad-Pro-come-with" class="headerlink" title="What accessories does the iPad Pro come with?"></a>What accessories does the iPad Pro come with?</h2><p>Unfortunately, the iPad Pro doesn’t come with any free accessories.

However, if you have ever made meringue, you know it takes a while to beat the eggs until they fluff up to the perfect consistency. With the KitchenAid, what would typically take me about 40 minutes to beat by hand is finished in a fraction of the time. </p><p>There are also many attachments that make the KitchenAid more than just a stand mixer; it is also a pasta maker, ice cream maker, slicer, shredder, and more.

Long before we had everything we needed on our phones, we had a portable player to listen to our music. In the history of portable audio players, there were Sony Walkmans, followed by CD players, and finally, the MP3 player dominated the early 2000s – especially with the debut of the iPod in 2001.</p><p>It may surprise you that MP3 players (also known as digital audio players or DAPs) are still very much around in 2024. The MP3 players of today sync to streaming services like Spotify, sport color and touchscreen displays, and offer expansive storage options. And while you may be listening to them with <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-wireless-earbuds/" >wireless earbuds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>instead of corded ones, they offer a sense of nostalgia while still giving us the advantages of today’s tech. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-bluetooth-speakers/" >The best Bluetooth speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rxyki8-Y630?si=dHLkIxG59zdlZeN0&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-the-best-MP3-player-right-now"><a href="#What-is-the-best-MP3-player-right-now" class="headerlink" title="What is the best MP3 player right now?"></a>What is the best MP3 player right now?</h2><p>We rounded up the top MP3 players you can buy by evaluating storage, battery life, media type, and price to deliver this curated list of picks.

For example, 16GB of memory equates to about 4,000 songs.</li><li><strong>Media types:</strong> While MP3 players of course take MP3 files, consider devices that support additional file types, including WMA, WAV, AAC, and more.</li><li><strong>Battery:</strong> The great thing about modern-day MP3 players is that they will have much better battery lives than the devices of the past. The average battery life for a good MP3 player will be about 12 hours.</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> MP3 players vary greatly in price, from budget-friendly picks to expensive ones built for audiophiles.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HtM7d4dpN1I?si=2vN_xgVGD4eYGORu&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-MP3-players"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-MP3-players" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these MP3 players?"></a>How did we choose these MP3 players?</h2><p>When choosing the best MP3 players, we do extensive research into different products and brands, taking into consideration user reviews (both good and bad), competitor analysis, and more.</p><h2 id="How-many-songs-does-an-MP3-player-hold"><a href="#How-many-songs-does-an-MP3-player-hold" class="headerlink" title="How many songs does an MP3 player hold?"></a>How many songs does an MP3 player hold?</h2><p>This all depends on the amount of storage that is on the MP3 device. The number of songs an MP3 player can hold will also depend on a song’s file format and compression rate, so these numbers may vary. Here is a quick guide for reference of how many songs typical storage types can hold: </p><ul><li>4GB &#x3D; 1,000 songs</li><li>8GB &#x3D; 2,000 songs</li><li>16GB &#x3D; 4,000 songs</li><li>32GB &#x3D; 8,000 songs</li><li>64GB &#x3D; 16,000 songs</li></ul><h2 id="Is-it-worth-it-to-buy-an-MP3-player"><a href="#Is-it-worth-it-to-buy-an-MP3-player" class="headerlink" title="Is it worth it to buy an MP3 player?"></a>Is it worth it to buy an MP3 player?</h2><p>In 2024, you might wonder if it’s even worth buying an MP3 player when you can just listen to music on your smartphone. However, MP3 players are great for kids who want to listen to music but don’t yet have a smartphone, people who like to run or hike outside, or those who simply want to listen to music without any distractions from their phones.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq2r4ZKM-Po?si=fA2DdEB1op-atCkz&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-the-different-audio-formats"><a href="#What-are-the-different-audio-formats" class="headerlink" title="What are the different audio formats?"></a>What are the different audio formats?</h2><p>Many MP3 players today support multiple audio files.

With Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft already having launched new products in recent months, Apple now finds itself <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apples-ai-advances-could-make-or-break-the-iphone-16/" >trailing behind <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the generative AI train.</p><p>“We will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence, where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said while discussing the first fiscal quarter of 2024. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-to-expect-from-wwdc-2024-siri-ai-upgrades-ios-18-macos-15-more/" >What to expect from WWDC 2024: Siri, AI upgrades, iOS 18, MacOS 15, more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Recent <a class="link"   href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-28/apple-eu-changes-sideloading-third-party-app-stores-are-future-of-the-iphone-lrxjzbg6" >reports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> hint that iOS 18, expected to be announced on Monday during WWDC and launch later this year, will be one of the biggest iOS updates in the company’s history, featuring RCS support and a smarter Siri. Sure, it’d be fun to see AI-powered music creation, a personalized fitness or meditation coach, and even AI-generated emojis, but here are the top four AI features I’m most excited (and hoping) to see with iOS 18.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cC-HtDQVoG0?si=nQcoa7q8q2IL8U0m&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Generative-AI-for-a-context-aware-Siri"><a href="#1-Generative-AI-for-a-context-aware-Siri" class="headerlink" title="1. Generative AI for a context-aware Siri"></a>1. Generative AI for a context-aware Siri</h2><p>Unfortunately, Siri is arguably Apple’s biggest shortcoming when stacking its AI services against competitors. While Siri has become a go-to feature on its own, it lags behind its virtual assistant competitors in intelligence and capability. Mounting consumer frustration over Siri’s limitations and generative AI’s popularity gives Apple a final push to give the voice assistant generative AI.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ways-apple-can-leapfrog-openai-microsoft-and-google-at-wwdc-2024/" >6 ways Apple can leapfrog OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google at WWDC 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If Apple can give Siri generative AI, iPhone users could ask the voice assistant for more than “Open this app” or “Search Google for this.” Generative AI would let users ask Siri to draft messages and emails, explain a concept, and give personalized reminders tailored to their calendars, notes, or contacts. </p><p>The biggest challenge for Apple will be running large language models (LLMs) on-device, as one would expect it to do after its long-standing focus on consumer privacy. On-device processing means questions and responses won’t have to be sent to remote cloud servers, minimizing data exposure.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6Wfzj6YNDM?si=WRZQD9zCdQ1_tW1b&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Contextual-search-through-image-gallery"><a href="#2-Contextual-search-through-image-gallery" class="headerlink" title="2.

This lets users search through photos <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-subtle-but-useful-ai-feature-was-my-favorite-google-io-2024-announcement/" >with natural language entries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, like searching for the word “Concert” and having the Photos app display all the photos and videos taken in a concert. With as many photos as I take daily, this is a feature I’d love to see added to iOS. </p><p>Apple already uses AI for facial recognition to create Memories and organize photos of people, places, and events. Adding more AI capabilities to the Photos app could allow iPhone users to search for photos using keywords or phrases, like “beach” or “picnic at Central Park last summer,” instead of scrolling through thousands of photos. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/10-things-id-like-to-see-in-visionos-2-0/" >10 things I’d like to see in VisionOS 2.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Other AI upgrades to photo galleries that could benefit smartphone users include finding and suggesting duplicate photos to free up storage, integrating AI voice assistants to search for photos with voice commands, recommending AI enhancements, and applying edits to photos. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNhKhWc0wLc?si=1XLYV0sXV52Xc0lu&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Personalized-text-generation"><a href="#3-Personalized-text-generation" class="headerlink" title="3.

In addition to suggesting AI enhancements for photos, it would be great to see iOS improve auto-enhancement options, retouching capabilities, automatic framing and composition, photo restoration, sky replacement, and colorization. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-3-apple-products-you-shouldnt-buy-this-month-including-this-ipad/" >The 3 Apple products you shouldn’t buy this month (including this iPad) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I don’t anticipate Apple adding AI video generators to its devices. These tools are less common than AI image generators because video is a more complex medium, despite the availability of TikTok and <a class="link"   href="https://www.capcut.com/" >Capcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> filters.</p><p>It would be surprising to see Apple incorporate AI video features such as real-time background replacement and cinematic effects based on AI scene interpretation into iPhone video editing, especially since this feature was recently introduced to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-new-final-cut-pro-for-ipad-features-are-game-changing-for-me-as-a-filmmaker/" >Final Cut Pro for iPad 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Apple"><a href="#Apple" class="headerlink" title="Apple"></a>Apple</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-hands-on/"  title="iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you&#39;ll get">iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you’ll get <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ios-18-settings-i-changed-immediately-and-why-you-should-too/"  title="6 iOS 18 settings I changed immediately -

After all, that device had the slab screen with a full touch surface instead of keys, cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connectivity, access (although terribly slow) to the Internet – and a camera. </p><p>Ever since, those attributes have defined all smartphones, save for one common smartphone capability that didn’t arrive until the iPhone 3GS in 2008: the App Store. Apps, together with the aforementioned hardware features, define the modern smartphone.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KdpTAZ9zonQ?si=5Nd5SPW1axA7GPuB&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="SPECIAL-FEATURE"><a href="#SPECIAL-FEATURE" class="headerlink" title="SPECIAL FEATURE"></a>SPECIAL FEATURE</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/collection/the-next-stage-of-mobile-tech/" >The Next Stage of Mobile Tech Smartphones remain the magical hubs of our digital lives, as we keep welcoming incremental advances like improved cameras, more foldable options, plus increasingly ubiquitous 5G. In 2024, our mobile devices look to wow us all over again – with on-device AI, Qi2 charging, and all manner of form factors clamoring for our attention. ZDNET brings it all into focus.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>But of all the capabilities and components of these amazing and ubiquitous computing devices, it is the smartphone <em>camera</em> that has seen the most extraordinary evolution. Phone cameras made their first appearance during the era when smartphones started becoming practical, everyday devices. Then, these cameras advanced in an App Store-centric world where companies like <a class="link"   href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagiccamera" >Blackmagic Design could create camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that redefine how a smartphone camera works. Now, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are changing the very nature of what a camera can do.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nlwr9LjJ-ng?si=I6UNAtfBkY2FTceu&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Pre-modern-smartphones"><a href="#Pre-modern-smartphones" class="headerlink" title="Pre-modern smartphones"></a>Pre-modern smartphones</h2><p>Identifying the first anything is always a tricky undertaking. The very first device labeled as a smartphone (they called it a “Smart Phone”) was the <a class="link"   href="https://www.mobilephonemuseum.com/phone-detail/gs-88" >Ericsson 88 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from 1997. Only 200 were made, and it was mostly a personal digital assistant. It most definitely did not have a camera.</p><p>But before the modern smartphones, phones with some modern smartphone attributes were introduced. The best known, of course, was the BlackBerry. The earliest BlackBerry devices, the 850 and 857 models weren’t even phones. They were pagers with email. It wasn’t until 2003 that the <a class="link"   href="https://crackberry.com/time-calls-blackberry-6210-one-most-influential-gadgets-all-time" >BlackBerry 6210 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with its famous keyboard and integrated phone, was released. But even then, the BlackBerry didn’t have a camera.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/" >The best phones we tested in 2023, including foldables and budget picks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Sharp – the company that makes my microwave oven – introduced what can be considered the world’s first camera phone. Released in 2000, it was called the <a class="link"   href="https://www.mobilephonemuseum.com/phone-detail/j-phone-j-sh04" >J-SHO4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and was available exclusively in the Japanese market. With its 110,000-pixel sensor, the J-SHO4 was capable of taking very low-res digital images – tiny, almost postage-stamp-sized images, with a 383x287 pixel resolution.</p><p>Samsung also lays claim to the title of “first phone with a built-in camera” – the <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://news.samsung.com/in/infographic-once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-phone-with-a-0-35mp-camera" >SCH-V200 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -- also released in 2000. This handset had a 0.35-megapixel sensor and could take up to 20 photos of 640x480 pixels before you had to hook it up to a computer and download the images. Samsung also claims to have invented the selfie camera. In 2002, the company released the SCH-X590, a flip phone with a rotating camera.</p><p>This was where the concept of megapixels started to take hold. The more data that could be stored, the more pixels there were. As photos started to get into the millions of pixels, the “megapixel” marketing term was created. Fundamentally, the more pixels, the higher the resolution of the image (and the more tinkering you can do with it).</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Another phone – and my personal device for four years – was the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/treo-600-debuts-with-new-improvements-and-old-design-flaws/" >Palm Treo 600 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, released in 2003. This device did a lot, including supporting a camera capable of taking 640x480 resolution images. The Treo didn’t have Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, limiting its connectivity to a cable connected to the computer for image downloads. Its big claim to fame was that it could run any of the thousands of PalmOS apps that were available for download. Installing those apps, however, also involved connecting a cable to a computer.</p><h2 id="2008-The-birth-of-the-modern-smartphone"><a href="#2008-The-birth-of-the-modern-smartphone" class="headerlink" title="2008: The birth of the modern smartphone"></a>2008: The birth of the modern smartphone</h2><p>Released on June 29, 2007, <a class="link"   href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070629165202/http://www.apple.com/iphone" >the iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was explosive. Many of us remember the lines of people waiting to get their first phone. I sat those lines out, happy with my Treo. While the first iPhone had nearly all of the characteristics of a modern smartphone, including a 2.0MP rear-facing camera, the only apps it allowed were crude customized web pages. My Treo had far better native PalmOS apps.</p><p>That first generation iPhone was not, in my opinion, the first true modern smartphone. For that, apps need to be installed directly on the handsets. When Apple’s iPhone 3G hit the market in July 2008 – along with the App Store – the world was never the same. Smartphone apps enabled billions of non-technical people to customize their phones, making it possible to install new software with a single click. </p><p>More specifically, apps can amplify camera functionality. With filter apps, users can easily add special effects or painterly screens over their images. Apps also paved the way for social media juggernauts like Instagram and TikTok. Consequently, social networking has become the force it is today with the ability for users to capture photos and videos, as well as share those with friends, family, and the whole world with the tap of a screen. With apps, photos and videos can go anywhere, instantly. </p><p>For serious photographers and videographers, apps can enhance phones’ cameras. The Blackmagic Design’s Camera app, for example, allows photo-savvy users to customize settings like frame rate, shutter angle, white balance, and ISO – the way professional photographers would in their photo-taking process.</p><p>The full-sized screen, high-speed Internet connectivity, fairly good to excellent cameras, and ability to completely customize phones with apps empowered people worldwide and put so much more than a little computer in their pockets. Everyone now has all this amazing power and flexibility, at all times.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-camera-phone/" >The best camera phones: Capture crystal-clear photos, videos, and selfies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Personally, the iPhone 3G was my first iPhone (there was no iPhone 2 or 3). I bought it and an iMac a few weeks after the phone was released, and went on to create <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/true-confessions-of-a-former-iphone-developer/" >40 iPhone apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. That iPhone 3G didn’t improve the camera hardware by much. That wouldn’t happen until the iPhone 3GS, which jumped from a 2.0- to a 3.0MP camera and started to record 30 frames-per-second video.</p><p>Over in the Android world, its first phone was the HTC Dream, also marketed as the <a class="link"   href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/t-mobile-g1-review/" >T-Mobile G1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It was released in October 2008 and was noteworthy for its slide-out display that opened to show a BlackBerry-style keyboard. This device came with a rear-facing 3.15MP camera.</p><p>With the iPhone 3 and the App Store, along with the first Android phone, it’s fair to say that 2008 was the first year of the modern smartphone era.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uV3vm805eX0?si=YSPcsFxBcJmoxLsU&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2010-Smartphones-meet-narcism-a-match-made-in-heaven"><a href="#2010-Smartphones-meet-narcism-a-match-made-in-heaven" class="headerlink" title="2010: Smartphones meet narcism, a match made in heaven"></a>2010: Smartphones meet narcism, a match made in heaven</h2><p>Smartphones have evolved with a cadence we’re all familiar with.

While all of the higher-end phones have exceptional camera systems, Sony is the only company that makes pro and prosumer cameras in addition to smartphones.

Both of these featured front-facing cameras, suitable for taking selfies. Neither had much to write home about in terms of resolution, but front-facing cameras also got better over the years.</p><p>Of course, as storage has improved both in capacity and speed, it’s possible to store even 8K video at 120 frames per second on SSDs connected to cameras over fast USB-C ports.

That’s roughly 16,384 x 12,288 pixels, for those who can even picture such a thing. Each highly-compressed JPEG takes 20-40MB, but an uncompressed RAW image takes 100MB per image or more.

That year, <a class="link"   href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-visual-core-image-processing-and-machine-learning-pixel-2/" >Google released the Pixel 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which got a portrait mode that blurred backgrounds, and improved processing for HDR images.</p><p>Apple, too, was focusing on portrait mode photography in 2017, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ar-iot-siri-and-machine-learning-will-iphone-x-showcase-changes-to-the-user-experience/" >introducing the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and iPhone X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Each of these devices included both a main processor and a Neural Engine – a processor dedicated to machine learning tasks.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-the-iphone-15-pro-max-challenges-mirrorless-cameras-we-compare-price-and-performance/" >How the iPhone 15 Pro Max challenges mirrorless cameras: We compare price and performance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Overall, these initial machine learning capabilities enhanced overall photo processing, improving aspects like auto-focus, exposure, color balancing, and noise reduction.

In each of those stages, the one common factor was that the camera was meant as a capture device. It didn’t do any of the art.</p><p>But all that is changing with modern smartphones. By embedding considerable machine learning technology inside these devices, the camera itself becomes a production partner in the creation of exceptional images and quality video.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vlogging-camera/" >The best vlogging cameras you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I asked Bob Caniglia, Blackmagic’s director of sales operations, about smartphone camera evolution.

Last year, Blackmagic introduced its Blackmagic Camera app, which takes the iPhone’s camera and gives it superpowers.</p><p>“Until recently,” Caniglia told me, “The discussion was mostly around how a smartphone’s camera was limited being in such a small physical device. And there is no doubt that there are still big differences between smartphones and larger professional cameras.”</p><p>“But the conversation has moved to the different ways cameras like the iPhone can be used,” he continued. “I think AI and machine learning features – like the iPhone 15’s scene, skin and sky segmentation and detection, periscope zoom lens, and Portrait Mode – have opened up the possibilities of how smartphones can be used by everyone.”</p><p>Let’s now explore the power that machine learning brings to smartphones. Specifically, I’ll talk about the machine learning magic incorporated into flagship phones like the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Google Pixel 8, the Samsung Galaxy S23, and the OnePlus 11.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gkdZ3A1mock?si=2zeR5GtTU2VujM_w&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Image-quality"><a href="#1-Image-quality" class="headerlink" title="1. Image quality"></a>1. Image quality</h3><p>Smartphones are now capable of making substantial enhancements to the quality of images as they are captured in the camera. Here are three examples of machine learning in use in the previously listed flagship phones. </p><p><strong>Image processing and enhancement:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/metas-ai-luminary-lecun-explores-deep-learnings-energy-frontier/" >Convolutional neural networks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> use a mathematical operation called convolution which calculates pixel values based on a sliding filter, helping the algorithm identify specific features like edges, textures, and shapes.</p><p>This then helps the machine learning algorithms to analyze and adjust parameters like exposure, contrast, and color balance to enhance quality. This is particularly useful in challenging lighting conditions; it’s how smartphones can take low-light and high-glare photos that previously were almost impossible to capture.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/metas-ai-luminary-lecun-explores-deep-learnings-energy-frontier/" >Meta’s AI luminary LeCun explores deep learning’s energy frontier <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p><strong>Low-light photography and night mode:</strong> Speaking of tough lighting conditions, machine learning provides a powerful assist in low-light photography, where it helps in noise reduction, detail enhancement, and color accuracy. It does this using neural network technology to process multiple exposures, merging them into a single image while enhancing detail and reducing noise. Of course, decisions about what detail to enhance and what noise to reduce is where the AI comes into play.</p><p><strong>HDR processing:</strong> High dynamic range (HDR) processing helps balance the dark and bright areas of an image for an improved dynamic range. Algorithms dynamically adjust the exposure of different regions in a photo, merging multiple exposures for a balanced high dynamic range image, keeping the visual fidelity of the image while allowing for blacker blacks, whiter whites, and other darker and lighter colors to better reflect what the photographer originally aimed to capture.</p><h3 id="2-Object-knowledge"><a href="#2-Object-knowledge" class="headerlink" title="2. Object knowledge"></a>2. Object knowledge</h3><p>During the film era, some analog techniques were possible for image improvement. Now, AI and ML are critical when it comes to having intelligence about what’s in a scene. Here are some of the powerful capabilities built into those smartphones I discussed earlier.</p><p><strong>Scene and object recognition:</strong> Smartphones can recognize various scenes – landscapes, portraits, or low-light settings – and objects within an image. Based on this recognition, the camera can optimize settings for the best shot. Deep learning algorithms utilizing convolutional neural networks have been trained on vast datasets to accurately recognize and categorize different scenes and objects in images. Often, heavily optimized versions of the results of that training are embedded either in the camera apps or even in the phones’ chipsets.</p><p><strong>Portrait mode and bokeh effect:</strong> Depth estimation models, often using ML techniques like semantic segmentation, can create a depth map of the scene, differentiating the subject from the background. This is how we get portrait mode, where the subject is in focus while the phone creates a seemingly artistically blurred background.</p><p><strong>Face detection and beautification:</strong> Computer vision algorithms can detect faces in an image and apply subtle enhancements, like skin smoothing or light adjusting, to improve portraits. This process is often done based on a library of learned aesthetic preferences.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-safety-and-bias-untangling-the-complex-chain-of-ai-training/" >AI safety and bias: Untangling the complex chain of AI training <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Some early facial recognition applications demonstrated bias. They were using very limited and, therefore, often biased training data. This is less of a problem today, as vendors are using vastly larger and more inclusive training sets. We need to continue to fight against <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-safety-and-bias-untangling-the-complex-chain-of-ai-training/" >bias in our AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>AI-powered filters and effects:</strong> Some of the earliest smartphone digital app photo features were creative filters and effects. Initially, these filters were mostly algorithmic, based on a programmer’s code. Over time, ML techniques like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/generative-ai-just-dont-call-it-an-artist-say-scholars-in-science-magazine/" >generative adversarial networks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> were applied.</p><p>This technique pits a “generator” algorithm against a “discriminator” algorithm process, where the discriminator provides feedback to the generator to drive improvement. The resulting learned effects, or style transfer processes, mimic the styles of various artists and techniques. This allows users to apply complex artistic styles to their photos, and for the resulting images to appear stylistically relevant. It also has <a class="link"   href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/judge-pares-down-artists-ai-copyright-lawsuit-against-midjourney-stability-ai-2023-10-30/" >resulted in lawsuits <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/generative-ai-just-dont-call-it-an-artist-say-scholars-in-science-magazine/" >Generative AI: Just don’t call it an ‘artist’ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/htnQWyEOCgc?si=fy86hi8_hTtbWAnw&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Quality-of-life-enhancements"><a href="#3-Quality-of-life-enhancements" class="headerlink" title="3. Quality-of-life enhancements"></a>3. Quality-of-life enhancements</h3><p>Smartphone cameras are not only taking better and better pictures and videos, but they’re also becoming easier to use at the same time. Here are a few quality-of-life enhancements that make smartphone cameras more helpful to their users. </p><p><strong>Video stabilization:</strong> Ever hear the phrase, “We’ll fix it in post”? That’s the process of repairing a film or video after it leaves filming, with the editor using a combination of smart tools and skills to create a good clip. But now, ML models can fix shaky video dynamically, right in the camera.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-new-camera-embeds-authenticity-details-in-photos-but-it-doesnt-come-cheap/" >This new camera embeds authenticity details in photos, but it doesn’t come cheap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>ML models in smartphones do this by analyzing motion patterns frame-by-frame to predict and correct camera shake and motion blur, resulting in a smoother clip. Usually, this “consumes” some of the edges of the video frame, creating a cropped but much more stable image.</p><p><strong>Autofocus and tracking:</strong> Before machine learning, lenses with autofocus used distance sensors and calculations to determine the focus point of the lens. But now, ML has improved autofocus performance, making it substantially faster and more accurate.</p><p>Predictive algorithms and object detection models are often used for real-time tracking of moving subjects, maintaining a focus lock while the subjects (or the camera operators) move.</p><p><strong>Automatically adapting to user preferences:</strong> Some smartphone cameras use reinforcement learning techniques to adapt to user preferences over time, and automatically adjust settings or suggest modes based on past usage.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/you-can-now-run-microsofts-ai-powered-copilot-as-a-free-android-app/" >You can now run Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilot as a free Android app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One thing that’s important to note: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/generative-ai-filled-us-with-wonder-in-2023-but-all-magic-comes-with-a-price/" >Generative AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is something that occurs <em>outside</em> of the camera.</p><p>As Blackmagic Design’s Caniglia said, “There’s been an incredible evolution of smartphone camera capabilities in comparison to just a couple of years ago. AI machine learning, especially with the new iPhone 15, has been a big driver. A huge part of that is because Apple has focused on developing technologies that do more with the actual information captured by the camera’s sensor rather than a focus on creations of “faux images” via generational AI.”</p><h2 id="Looking-to-the-future"><a href="#Looking-to-the-future" class="headerlink" title="Looking to the future"></a>Looking to the future</h2><p>We’ve been doing a tremendous amount of coverage of <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/topic/artificial-intelligence/" >generative AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> this past year. And every year, phone vendors introduce even more smartphone capabilities. So what does the future hold?</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/generative-ai-filled-us-with-wonder-in-2023-but-all-magic-comes-with-a-price/" >Generative AI filled us with wonder in 2023 - but all magic comes with a price <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The simple answer is: ever-increasing capacity and higher and higher quality images. That’s the trajectory smartphone machine learning has been on for the past decade or so.</p><p>But as I’ve started to explore VR with the Meta Quest 3 headset, I’m starting to think there’s another path for smartphones.</p><p>After Apple’s WWDC keynote last year, I wrote an analysis the announcement of its Vision Pro XR headset. While I was fairly bullish on the overall idea, I <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-vision-pro-a-concept-prototype-with-this-enormous-potential/" >derided its 3D camera playback capability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Apple showed a ludicrous demo where a father, wearing a Vision Pro, used it to film a 3D “movie” of his kid’s birthday. But while that example was aspirationally wacky, capturing 3D video clips could prove hugely beneficial for training courses and other demonstrations, to be embedded inside of point-of-function applications.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-a-claustrophobic-guy-with-glasses-learn-to-stop-worrying-and-love-meta-quest-3/" >Can a claustrophobic guy with glasses learn to stop worrying and love Meta’s Quest 3? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I think I was wrong. I’ve been <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-a-claustrophobic-guy-with-glasses-learn-to-stop-worrying-and-love-meta-quest-3/" >using the Meta Quest 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for about a week and have looked at the Quest’s relatively rudimentary 3D home movies. There’s something there. It’s not like just watching a film. Once you enter VR, you really get the feels.</p><p>Beyond capturing personal memories, 3D VR camera capture has some enormous potential, especially once we move beyond heavy consoles on our faces and into clear glasses. I expect to see a ton of AI and ML applied to images and videos used in that context.</p><p>What are your thoughts about the future of photography and video, and how AI and ML can help?

One of the biggest updates comes by way of Final Cut Pro for iPad, which will unleash some very impressive (and useful) features for creatives. One feature that many creators working within the Apple ecosystem will appreciate is the new Live Multicam option, which allows you to connect and preview up to four cameras all in one place. </p><p>That feature is enabled with the help of Final Cut Camera, which is an all-new video-capturing app for both <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/" >iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allows creators to connect and remotely direct with powerful controls.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-announced-at-its-ipad-event-today-ipad-pro-air-pencil-m4-and-more/" >Everything Apple announced at its iPad event: iPad Pro, Air, Pencil, M4, and more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Each live camera feed can be controlled directly from Final Cut Pro for iPad to change things like exposure settings, focus, ISO, white balance, and zoom. You’ll even gain access to manual focus, which can be a real game-changer. Those features alone make this new version worth considering. </p><p>I’ve worked on enough film projects to understand how important it is to be able to control focus remotely. Instead of having to manually adjust the focus on each camera, you can do it all from a single device. Doing that with cinema cameras requires expensive hardware and a considerable learning curve. This should make it exponentially easier.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The one caveat to the Live Multicam option is that it does seem to be limited to iPhones and iPads, so if you use cinema cameras or DSLRs for your shoots, you probably won’t be able to work with the new feature. If, however, you shoot with iPhones or iPads, you’re in luck.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-preorder-the-new-ipad-pro-ipad-air-apple-pencil-pro-and-magic-keyboard/" >How to preorder the new iPad Air, iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, and Apple Pencil Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Final Cut Camera will also serve as a video capture app on iPhone and iPad and even allows you to open and edit projects directly from an external drive, thanks to the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPad Pro’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Thunderbolt connection.</p><p>With the help of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-ipad-pros-new-outrageously-powerful-m4-chip-designed-for-ai-workloads/" >M4 chip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the iPad Pro, you’ll not only be able to use the Live Multicam feature, but also be able to do color grading (with up to 12 new color-grading presets), choose from eight basic text titles, score with 20 new soundtracks, apply effects to clips, render complex timelines, and more… without having to first migrate your project to an Mac or MacBook. </p><p>The upcoming version of Final Cut Pro for MacOS will also leverage AI to give editors the ability to quickly customize the look of videos, real time visuals, have better control over color correction and effects, and enjoy easier navigation of timelines. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-vs-ipad-air-2024/" >iPad Pro (2024) vs. iPad Air (2024): Which Apple tablet should you buy? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Post-production gets a boost with the ability to name workflows, color corrections, and video effects, which can then be dragged from the inspector to clips in the timeline.</p><p>As for availability:</p><ul><li>Final Cut Pro for iPad 2 will be available later this spring as a free update for existing users or available in the App Store for $4.99 per month or $49 per year.</li><li>Final Cut Camera will be available for free later this spring.</li><li>Final Cut Pro for MacOS (version 10.8) will be available as a free update for existing users and for $299 for new users on the Mac App Store.</li></ul><p>Read more about the exciting new features and updates coming to Apple products on the <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/final-cut-pro-transforms-video-creation-with-live-multicam-on-ipad-and-new-ai-features-on-mac/" >official announcement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-im-recommending-the-standard-iphone-16-over-the-pro-this-year-and-im-not-alone/"  title="Why I&#39;m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I&#39;m not alone)">Why I’m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-onedrive-messing-with-your-files-how-to-get-your-windows-storage-under-control/"  title="Is OneDrive messing with your files?

View at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Over the past week, I’ve been exercising, traveling, and sleeping with the new <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-ultra&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Apple Watch Ultra 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find out exactly where the company has pushed the envelope this time around. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >Best Apple Watches of 2023: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I’ll cut right to the chase: If you already own an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-vs-ultra-is-it-time-to-upgrade/" >Apple Watch Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, there is no compelling reason to upgrade to the Ultra 2. But if you’re one of the many who are planning to buy an Ultra wearable for the first time, this is as good as it gets. Here’s why.</p><p>Given today’s economic environment with rising consumer prices, I am a bit surprised that Apple was able to hold the price of the new Watch Ultra 2 at the same level as last year. When you consider the titanium construction, integrated LTE radio, and sapphire glass display, $799 is very reasonable for a high-performance sports watch. That’s more true when you compare the Apple Watch Ultra 2 to other flagship GPS sports watches. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>As far as what’s new with the model, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 incorporates a faster S9 processor, a brighter display, twice the internal storage, and a series of recycled materials that, somehow, don’t make the wearable feel any bit worse. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-issues-emergency-security-updates-for-iphone-ipad-and-apple-watch/" >Apple issues security fixes for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch to fight Predator spyware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>WatchOS 10 was released when the Watch Ultra 2 was announced and it’s made the Apple Watch experience an absolute joy to use, with new functions for the side button and digital crown (Smart Stack), along with spacious and info-rich watch faces that are optimized for the Watch Ultra models.</p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Naturally, I placed the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-vs-ultra/" >Watch Ultra 2 next to my first-gen Watch Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and they were virtually indistinguishable from each other. After cranking up the brightness of both, I could barely tell the difference in standard lighting conditions due to Apple’s implementation of the same ambient light sensor. But in the outdoors, which is where you’ll be leveraging the Watch Ultra’s technologies the most, it was apparent that the Ultra 2 was significantly brighter (3,000 nits compared to 2,000 nits).</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-tips-2023/" >Apple pro tips: The best new features in iPhone 15, iOS 17, and Apple Watch unlocked <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Prior to the Watch Ultra 2 launch, I listed <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-three-features-that-would-make-me-upgrade-from-the-last-model/" >three features that I wanted to see <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to warrant an upgrade, and while Apple did not provide them, it did address one of my desires in a unique manner. The LED flashlight on <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-garmin-watch/" >Garmin watches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a tool that I use daily. On the Watch Ultra 2, once you turn on the flashlight, spinning the digital crown now ups the maximum brightness, making use of the extra nits. </p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>It still doesn’t beat out the Garmin LED, but it is much more practical than last year’s for finding things in the garage or under the bed, illuminating rooms at night, and finding your way in the dark outside.</p><p>Mapping, unfortunately, is still limited on the Apple Watch Ultra 2, with the most notable change being offline maps support, provided you have an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-every-iphone-that-will-get-ios-17/" >iPhone on iOS 17 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. However, the Compass app has also received a subtle yet significant upgrade thanks to watchOS 10. On the Watch Ultra 2, it now shows a waypoint for the last-detected cellular and emergency SOS locations, so you know exactly where to return to if you find yourself in a dead zone. The Compass app also lets you mark your camping spot, parking spot, and other useful waypoints.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apple-weaved-ai-into-the-iphone-15-and-apple-watch-9/" >How Apple weaved AI into the iPhone 15 and Apple Watch 9 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Alongside Watch Ultra 2, Apple released new carbon-neutral watch bands, with three colors being offered across the Alpine Loop and Trail Loop bands. I had a chance to test the gray&#x2F;green Trail Loop with the Watch Ultra 2, and all I can say is that it’s extremely comfortable. I bought my Watch Ultra with an Ocean band last year but will likely pick up the Trail Loop this time around due to its easy Velcro secure support. For more casual outings, it’s the ideal watch band.</p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Finally, as much as I enjoy the Apple Watch Ultra 2 for its long battery life, brighter display, expanded connectivity, and new watch bands, I’ve also been enjoying the improved mental health functionality via the Mindfulness app. It has now earned a prominent spot in my app list, and I’ve been entering my state of mind on a daily basis. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-watchos-10-feature-is-overlooked-underrated-and-life-changing/" >My favorite WatchOS 10 feature is overlooked, underrated, and life-changing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I now frequently use the Reflect and Breathe utilities, which have slowly but surely reduced my stress, proving to be a welcome addition to my Apple Watch use. (Of course, you only need an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> running on watchOS 10 to use the Mindfulness app. I just like using it on the larger display of the Ultra!)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KXVWj6Ar1M?si=Cd_jktmoN3e9OzH3&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ZDNET’s-buying-advice"><a href="#ZDNET’s-buying-advice" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET’s buying advice"></a>ZDNET’s buying advice</h2><p>With my primary SIM now living as an eSIM in the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro/6.7-inch-display-256gb-natural-titanium-unlocked&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 Pro Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHX9N594?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ccf051f5e-8c27-4aef-8ea0-13f4f3fd2a79%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Apple Watch Ultra 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be staying on my wrist for an extended period of time – likely until the next Ultra version comes out. Apple’s improvements this year don’t push the envelope in any particular way, but they’re well-rounded enough to make the Watch Ultra still the best flagship sports watch that enthusiasts should buy.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/" >The best smartwatches of 2023: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If you don’t have an Apple Watch Ultra but are interested in buying one, the Ultra 2 is the best option.

computing environment when they require extra horsepower.</p><p>Called “Private Cloud Compute,” the service “allows Apple intelligence to flex and scale its computational capacity and draw on even

whether it can be processed on device,” he explained. “If it needs greater computational capacity, it can draw on private cloud compute and send only the data that’s relevant to your task.”</p><p>Apple emphasized that user data will not be gathered by the company, in contrast to the general AI industry practice of using individuals’ and companies’ data for <a class="link"

Once you add a card to your Apple Wallet, you enable Apple Pay on your iPhone. But if you have an active Apple Watch linked to that iPhone, you can also use Apple Pay with just your watch, even if you don’t have your iPhone with you when you check out. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >The best Apple Watches: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In order to use Apple Pay for contactless payments with your Apple Watch, you need to set up the Apple Wallet in your watch by adding your credit or debit cards to it separately.

With the new OS version, you can directly customize, move, and rearrange the sections and icons in Control Center, letting you set up multiple screens that are easily accessible with just a swipe. Adding a new control is also simpler and more intuitive. Here’s how this works.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-ios-18-features-ive-been-using-on-android-for-a-while/" >5 iOS 18 features I’ve been using on Android for a while <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>With previous versions of iOS, you’d have to head to Settings to customize Control Center, choosing which controls to add or remove. With iOS 18, you can tweak and manage the icons directly in Control Center itself. This means you can visually add, remove, and otherwise organize the different controls.</p><p>If you want to follow along, you’ll need to install the iOS 18 public beta on an iPhone. Though the public beta should be more stable than the earlier developer beta, you may want to set this up on a spare iPhone if one is available. To install the beta, follow the steps in “<a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-just-released-the-ios-18-public-beta-heres-how-to-get-it-on-your-iphone-right-now/" >Apple just released the iOS 18 public beta.

To start, tap the plus icon in the upper-left corner to segue to edit mode. Notice that the controls all have a border around them with the familiar minus sign at the top.

Pick a screen with some empty space at the bottom. After tapping the plus icon, tap the command for “Add a Control.” Browse the screens of accessible controls until you find the one you want to add. You can also look for a specific control by name through the Search field at the top.

Tap that control, and it should appear in a new screen. You can continue adding more controls to the new screen this way.

When you trigger Control Center in iOS 18, you’ll see a power button in the upper-right corner. Pressing down on that button takes you to the familiar Power Off screen. Move the icon on the slider to the right, and your phone will shut down.</p><p>Screenshot by Lance Whitney&#x2F;ZDNET</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/"  title="20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really">20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/"  title="Want a programming job?

It took a while, but you’re finally getting a little reciprocity if you want to switch from Android to iOS.</p><p>Today, the <a class="link"   href="https://dtinit.org/blog/2024/07/10/DTI-members-new-photo-video-tool" >Data Transfer Initiative announced <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Apple and Google are expanding on that earlier tool and letting you transfer <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-photos-users-will-soon-get-the-best-ai-editing-tools-on-pixel-devices-for-free/" >Google Photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> collections to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-icloud-photos-now-works-with-windows-11-photos-app/" >iCloud Photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The tool will be rolling out over the next week.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/magic-editor-and-other-ai-features-in-google-photos-are-coming-to-your-phone-for-free/" >Magic Editor and other AI features in Google Photos are coming to your phone for free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Both <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/9666875" >Google <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213483" >Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> have released support pages explaining the process. Here’s how to move your pictures: </p><ul><li>Turn on iCloud Photos and iCloud Drive if they’re not already enabled, and make sure you have enough iCloud storage.</li><li>Head to <a class="link"   href="https://takeout.google.com/takeout/transfer/custom/plus%5Fphotos?pli=1" >Google Takeout <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>Choose which albums you want to transfer (the default is all photos).</li><li>Select the third-party service you want to move your photos to. Right now, the only options are Flickr, Microsoft OneDrive, and SmugMug, but iCloud should arrive within a few days.</li></ul><p>Apple says you can only transfer basic photo and video files to iCloud Photos. Other file types like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-create-animated-cinematic-photos-with-the-google-photos-app/" >Motion Photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Live Photos, or Memories are a no-go. Transferred photos should include all original metadata, descriptions, and file names.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Once the transfer finishes, you’ll get an email with a link to find your photos in iCloud. Your Google account will no longer have access to iCloud after the transfer, Google says, but it might still appear in iCloud settings. If it does, you can remove it.</p><p>Google notes that the visibility of transferred photos and videos depends on iCloud sharing permissions. If you transfer items again, Google will send a new copy, and if you cancel your Google Takeout request, there may be a delay before you can request it again.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-overhauls-icloud-for-windows-app-with-new-features-and-fixes/" >Apple overhauls iCloud for Windows with new features and fixes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Accounts for children or accounts through a school or organization aren’t eligible for photo transfers.</p><p>Apple says the transfer may take several hours or even several days depending on how many files you have, and that your original photos will stay in your Google account.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-im-recommending-the-standard-iphone-16-over-the-pro-this-year-and-im-not-alone/"  title="Why I&#39;m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I&#39;m not alone)">Why I’m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-onedrive-messing-with-your-files-how-to-get-your-windows-storage-under-control/"  title="Is OneDrive messing with your files?
