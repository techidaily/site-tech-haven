However, since the Apple Watch is available in different variants, it can be a challenge to figure out which model is right for you, whether you are buying one for the first time or upgrading to a newer model. </p><p>While the Apple Watch started as a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-fitness-tracker/" >fitness tracker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> slightly more sophisticated than a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-fitbit/" >Fitbit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it has steadily expanded to become an expansive health monitoring device and a handy tool for fast access to information and apps. It can now check your heart rate, carry your boarding pass for a flight, identify a song that’s playing nearby, open your garage door, alert you when it’s about to rain, and guide you to breathe when you get stressed – and those are just a few examples. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/"><strong>The best smartwatches: Expert tested</strong></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-right-now"><a href="#What-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-right-now" class="headerlink" title="What is the best Apple Watch right now?"></a>What is the best Apple Watch right now?</h2><p>Based on my years of testing, my pick for the best Apple Watch overall is the <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-ultra-2-gps-cellular-49mm-titanium-case-with-orange-beige-trail-loop-medium-large-titanium/6574421.p?skuId=6574421&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >Apple Watch Ultra 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, thanks to its large screen, 24-hour battery life, and emergency siren.

The most notable and useful difference between the Ultra and the other Apple Watch models is the larger, brighter, flatter screen that’s covered by a sapphire crystal face and surrounded by a titanium case to considerably increase the amount of wear and tear it can handle. It’s also IPX6 dust resistant, works underwater up to 100 meters (328 feet), and has military-grade (MIL-STD 810H) certification for ruggedness. Plus, the Ultra 2 can handle high altitudes, shocks, vibrations, and temperatures as low as 4 degrees Fahrenheit and as high as 130 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p><strong>Review: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-spent-a-week-with-the-apple-watch-ultra-2-and-heres-what-stood-out-the-most/" >Apple Watch Ultra 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>ZDNET contributing writer Matthew Miller also tried out the Apple Watch Ultra 2 when it was released last year, and said he enjoyed the watch “for its long battery life, brighter display, expanded connectivity, and new watch bands” while also being impressed by the improved mental health functionality via the Mindfulness app.</p><p>The Ultra 2 adds more exclusive features as well, including a programmable Action Button with a variety of workout and adventuring functions (it can also simply activate the flashlight), dual-frequency GPS that can overcome interference from mountains and skyscrapers, and dual integrated speakers that are much louder for taking phone calls, playing music, or interacting with Siri. </p><p>Many Amazon reviewers who have bought this watch say that it’s the best Apple Watch model they have ever used, calling out the watch’s quality and large 49mm screen with 3,000 nits of brightness in particular. Beyond that, the Ultra offers one key addition to the Apple Watch Series 9 lineup: an emergency siren (activated by holding down the Action Button), which belts out an 86-decibel sound pattern that can be heard up to 600 feet (180 meters) away. This can help if you get lost or take a fall on a hike to ward off wild animals or to scare off attackers.</p><p><strong>Apple Watch Ultra 2 tech specs</strong>: <strong>Display Size:</strong> 49mm | <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 72 hours | <strong>Storage capacity:</strong> 64GB | <strong>Features:</strong> Sturdy titanium case and sapphire crystal face, enhanced safety features including a built-in siren, dual-frequency GPS, works up to 100 meters underwater</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/376373/633495/10014?prodsku=6574327&u=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252F-%252F6574327.p%253Fcmp%253DRMX&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Brighter screen</li><li>Full array of health sensors</li><li>Hands-free double-tap gesture</li><li>More accurate Siri commands</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Cellular connectivity costs extra</li><li>Not as durable as the Ultra 2</li></ul><h2 id="Apple-Watch-Series-9"><a href="#Apple-Watch-Series-9" class="headerlink" title="Apple Watch Series 9"></a>Apple Watch Series 9</h2><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-for-most-people"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-for-most-people" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch for most people"></a>Best Apple Watch for most people</h3><p>The Apple Watch Series 9 can track activity, steps, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen (lung function), wrist temperature, sleep, and environmental sound levels (to protect your hearing), all of which customers who have reviewed the watch say “make day to day living so much easier.” And it uses algorithms and machine learning to spot dangerous patterns and alert you to seek medical attention if needed. There are now <a class="link"   href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-watch-lifesaving-health-features-read-5-peoples-stories/" >many stories of people who’ve had life-saving experiences <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with health alerts from an Apple Watch. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-review/"><strong>Apple Watch Series 9</strong></a></p><p>In my hands-on testing, there are two big upgrades in the Apple Watch Series 9. The first is a 2,000 nit display that is double the brightness of last year’s S8. The second is the new S9 SiP processor, which has a 30% faster GPU and processes machine learning twice as fast. This makes everything quicker, makes the animations smoother, and enables features like the new double-tap gesture and faster and more accurate Siri commands.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-vs-apple-watch-series-8/"><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Apple Watch Series 8: Should you upgrade?</strong></a></p><p>If you want the latest health sensors and safety features, great battery life (especially if you want to do sleep tracking), and you don’t need the extreme features in the Ultra 2, then you can save a lot of money by going with the aluminum model of the Apple Watch Series 9 starting at $399. However, if you decide you want the tougher stainless steel finish (starting at $699), then I’d say skip that and go straight to the Ultra because for $100 more, you get a lot of extra features. The one exception to that might be if you have a smaller wrist.</p><p><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 tech specs: Display size:</strong> 41mm or 45mm | <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 36 hours | <strong>Storage capacity:</strong> 64GB | <strong>Features:</strong> New features include a 2x brighter display, double-tap gesture, new pink color, robust S9 processor, and all the best health sensors Apple has to offer</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5W9QWZ?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca2dd95fa-54d7-48f7-8b00-6de51c203b98%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Family Setup for kids and older adults</li><li>Health and location tracking</li><li>Fall and crash detection</li><li>Very affordable</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Not as durable as other Apple Watch models</li><li>Cellular connection requires a monthly fee</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1495277">                    <video width="1536" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1495277">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:960px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ffunwhole.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1495277%2F17189'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1495277/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Apple-Watch-SE-2nd-generation"><a href="#Apple-Watch-SE-2nd-generation" class="headerlink" title="Apple Watch SE (2nd generation)"></a>Apple Watch SE (2nd generation)</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975562">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975562">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975562%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975562/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-for-kids-and-first-time-buyers"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-for-kids-and-first-time-buyers" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch for kids and first-time buyers"></a>Best Apple Watch for kids and first-time buyers</h3><p>Starting at $249, what I found amazing about the Apple Watch SE (2nd gen) is how many of the same health and safety features from the Series 8 and the Ultra it actually includes. It’s easier to talk about what’s not included in the SE – it doesn’t track blood oxygen, do ECG heart checks, or check your temperature. And while the face looks just like the Series 8, the screen is actually about 20% smaller, and it also doesn’t have an always-on display.</p><p>Still, it includes nearly everything else, and the cellular connectivity is only a $50 add-on for the SE (compared to a $100 add-on for the Series 8). Like the Ultra and the Series 8, adding a cellular connection will also cost you about $10&#x2F;month with your wireless carrier. Even if you go with the cellular version and opt for the larger 44mm Apple Watch SE over the smaller 40mm version, you’ll still only top out at $329.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-se-2022-vs-apple-watch-se-2020-should-you-upgrade/" >Apple Watch SE (2022) vs Apple Watch SE (2020): Should you upgrade? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That makes it a great smartwatch to give to someone who doesn’t have an iPhone, such as a child or an elderly family member, using <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211768" >Apple’s Family Setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With cellular connectivity, they can use the Apple Watch to make and receive phone calls, get text messages, dictate replies to texts, and connect to online info like the weather. </p><p>You can even set it up from your iPhone as long as they are in your Apple family group. If you are connecting an elderly relative who has health issues, the added health sensors in the Series 8 might make it worth the peace of mind to upgrade. Customers who have reviewed the watch also agree that it offers excellent value for the price, especially if you are new to the Apple Watch family.</p><p><strong>Apple Watch SE tech specs: Display size:</strong> 40mm or 44mm | <strong>Battery life</strong>: Up to 18 hours | <strong>Storage capacity:</strong> 32GB | <strong>Features:</strong> Most affordable Apple Watch, family setup for kids and older adults, health and location tracking, and fall and crash detection</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Green-Aluminum-Clover/dp/B09HF1DC1J?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca2dd95fa-54d7-48f7-8b00-6de51c203b98%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Comes in unique blue and green colors</li><li>Good deal if you buy used or refurbished</li><li>Has most of the latest health features</li><li>Water, dust, and crack resistant</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Shorter battery life than the Series 8 or Series 9</li><li>Display isn’t as bright as the Series 9</li></ul><h2 id="Apple-Watch-Series-7"><a href="#Apple-Watch-Series-7" class="headerlink" title="Apple Watch Series 7"></a>Apple Watch Series 7</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123511/26400" target="_top" id="2123511">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123511" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123511/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-for-unique-colors"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-for-unique-colors" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch for unique colors"></a>Best Apple Watch for unique colors</h3><p>When it first launched in fall 2021, the Apple Watch Series 7 brought key upgrades including a 20% larger screen, fast charging (0% to 80% in 45 minutes with a USB-C cable), a more durable face that’s made out of crystal and is 50% thicker than the previous model, and IPX6 dust resistance. Those are features that still aren’t available on the Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-7-review/" >Apple Watch Series 7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>With the SE now holding down the entry-level Apple Watch market, it’s best to think about buying the Series 7 in comparison to the SE. If you just want a low-cost entry into the Apple Watch ecosystem and an easy purchase, then you can buy a new SE and quickly get started. A new Apple Watch Series 7 costs nearly the same price as the Series 8, so it’s much better to get the Series 8. However, you can find a refurbished Series 7 for $200-$250 on places like <a class="link"   href="https://www.backmarket.com/en-us/l/apple-watch/38fd0158-d500-43d2-817c-738859e3e7dd#model=999%20Apple%20Watch%20Series%207" >BackMarket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.refurb.me/refurbished/apple-watch/series-7" >RefurbMe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Amazon also sells refurbished models, and the overall reviews from customers who bought a previously owned Apple Watch Series 7 were positive, with no complaints about battery life or the condition of the watch.</p><p>There are really only a few great reasons to buy the Series 7 at this point. The first is if you want the additional health features (heart and lung tracking) for an Apple Watch you’re giving to an elderly relative or if you want the extra durability for an Apple Watch you’re giving to a kid. The other big reason to buy the Series 7 is that it comes in two really nice colors – green and blue – that Apple no longer offers for the Series 8. But again, if you’re going to get a Series 7, I’d recommend getting a refurbished one.</p><p><strong>Apple Watch Series 7 tech specs: Display size:</strong> 41mm or 45mm | <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 18 hours | <strong>Storage</strong>: 32GB | <strong>Features:</strong> Large display, fast charging, health-focused features, and more durable than the SE</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-hermes/&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>High-quality, stylish bands</li><li>Exclusive Hermès watch faces</li><li>Includes an extra Sports Band in the box</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Expensive for what you get</li><li>Same features as regular Series 9</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993650">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993650">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993650%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993650/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Apple-Watch-Hermes"><a href="#Apple-Watch-Hermes" class="headerlink" title="Apple Watch Hermès"></a>Apple Watch Hermès</h2><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-for-dressing-up"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-for-dressing-up" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch for dressing up"></a>Best Apple Watch for dressing up</h3><p>If you’re looking to splurge on a designer smartwatch, the Apple Watch Hermès is a chic option for fashionistas.

The best reason to get it is the fact that it comes in two unique colors you can’t get in the Series 9.</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Watch Hermès</td><td>An Apple Watch for dressing up as well as working out.

Depending on the size of your wrist and how much you want to interact with the watch for quick actions, the display size will be a big factor in determining which model makes the most sense.</li><li><strong>Features:</strong> Apple methodically adds more and more new features to the Apple Watch each year, so we compared safety features, health sensors, band options, battery life, and other useful options.</li><li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Each Apple Watch has a number of different variations, so pricing can vary widely – especially based on which band you pick. We included budget-worthy options below $250, as well as the more premium options that are over $1,000.</li></ul><h2 id="How-we-test-smartwatches"><a href="#How-we-test-smartwatches" class="headerlink" title="How we test smartwatches"></a>How we test smartwatches</h2><p>All of the Apple Watches included in this list were chosen based on how they performed when <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-smartwatches-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tested in the real world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by the ZDNET team. When we test smartwatches, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.</p><ul><li><strong>Daily wear</strong>: We wear the smartwatch as our primary watch, with communications, applications, and other elements being tested as if it were our only smartwatch.</li><li><strong>Application selection and performance</strong>: One aspect that makes smartwatches different than standard watches is the support for applications. We load up the watch with apps and then test the performance and functionality of those applications. For example, Apple particularly excels in the area of third-party application support.</li><li><strong>Workouts</strong>: Smartwatch makers have embraced health and fitness so we take smartwatches out for running with GPS, rowing on the Hydrow, biking on trails, and walking with the family. GPS and heart rate data is tracked and then we evaluate the accuracy against proven GPS sports watches.</li><li><strong>Sleep and activity tracking:</strong> Sleep tracking has improved with smartwatches over time and we evaluate and compare them to smart rings and other watches. Nighttime is also a good time to charge your smartwatch, so you may choose not to use your watch to track sleep so your watch can serve faithfully all day and into the night.</li></ul><p>For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-smartwatches-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >smartwatch testing methodology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="What-is-new-in-the-Apple-Watch-10"><a href="#What-is-new-in-the-Apple-Watch-10" class="headerlink" title="What is new in the Apple Watch 10?"></a>What is new in the Apple Watch 10?</h2><p>Apple just announced the new Apple Watch Series 10 during its September event, and there are several notable features. First, the screen sizes are bigger (42 mm and 46 mm), and Apple said this is the thinnest Apple Watch to date, meaning it should be more comfortable on your wrist. </p><p>The Series 10 also has a new <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-10-gains-sleep-apnea-detection-and-it-could-save-your-life/" >sleep apnea-tracking feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which monitors movements associated with respiratory pattern interruptions and is tracked by Apple’s new Breathing Disturbances metric. </p><p>There is also a new depth gauge, which measures up to six meters beneath the water’s surface, and a water temperature sensor, which is great if you’re into water sports. </p><p>Finally, the Apple Watch 10 has a new jet black finish, along with “updated” rose gold and brushed silver aluminum finishes. </p><p>The Apple Watch 10 costs $399 and is available Friday, September 20. You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch" >preorder here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><h2 id="Do-you-need-an-iPhone-to-use-an-Apple-Watch"><a href="#Do-you-need-an-iPhone-to-use-an-Apple-Watch" class="headerlink" title="Do you need an iPhone to use an Apple Watch?"></a>Do you need an iPhone to use an Apple Watch?</h2><p>Yes, you need an iPhone to set up an Apple Watch. However, with all the models on this list, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211768" >Family Setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> option to have one iPhone set up watches for multiple members in your Apple family group – even if they don’t have an iPhone.

The latest versions have additional features and functionality, including sleep tracking, advanced health monitoring, car crash detection, and international emergency calling. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094477/7443" target="_top" id="2094477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094477/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-older-versions-of-the-Apple-Watch-still-worth-buying"><a href="#Are-older-versions-of-the-Apple-Watch-still-worth-buying" class="headerlink" title="Are older versions of the Apple Watch still worth buying?"></a>Are older versions of the Apple Watch still worth buying?</h2><p>Yes, many older Apple Watch are available to buy refurbished at places like <a class="link"   href="https://www.backmarket.com/en-us/l/apple-watch/38fd0158-d500-43d2-817c-738859e3e7dd" >BackMarket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are still some of the best smartwatches on the market. Just keep in mind that Apple releases a new Apple Watch each year, so a refurbished model that is already dated could end up being four or five generations behind the latest innovations during the time you own it.</p><h2 id="What-are-some-features-to-look-for-in-the-best-Apple-Watch-models"><a href="#What-are-some-features-to-look-for-in-the-best-Apple-Watch-models" class="headerlink" title="What are some features to look for in the best Apple Watch models?"></a>What are some features to look for in the best Apple Watch models?</h2><p>The most important features to look for in the best Apple Watch models include advanced health sensors (ECG, blood oxygen, wrist temperature, etc.), connectivity options (is cellular included or extra, if you want the watch to work when an iPhone isn’t nearby), battery life, and durability (water resistance, dust resistance, and a crystal face to resist cracking).</p><h2 id="Which-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-for-fitness-tracking"><a href="#Which-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-for-fitness-tracking" class="headerlink" title="Which is the best Apple Watch for fitness tracking?"></a>Which is the best Apple Watch for fitness tracking?</h2><p>The best Apple Watch for fitness tracking is the Apple Watch Series 9 or the Apple Watch Ultra 2, which both come equipped with the widest variety of health sensors, including ECG, sleep tracking, heart and breathing functions, wrist temperature, and more.</p><h2 id="What-is-the-difference-between-the-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Series-8-and-Series-7"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-the-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Series-8-and-Series-7" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 8, and Series 7?"></a>What is the difference between the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 8, and Series 7?</h2><p>The Apple Watch Series 9 brings a 2,000-nit display (twice as bright as the Series 8), a new hands-free double-tap gesture, and the new S9 SiP, which makes the watch run faster and smoother. The Apple Watch Series 8 introduced a more scratch-resistant crystal face, a temperature sensor, next-gen motion tracking, crash detection, and emergency SOS (all of which are also included in the Series 9). These are all features that the Series 7 doesn’t include, but it features two unique colors – blue and green – no longer available on either the Series 9 or the Series 8.</p><h2 id="Is-the-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-worth-the-extra-cost-for-outdoor-enthusiasts"><a href="#Is-the-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-worth-the-extra-cost-for-outdoor-enthusiasts" class="headerlink" title="Is the Apple Watch Ultra 2 worth the extra cost for outdoor enthusiasts?"></a>Is the Apple Watch Ultra 2 worth the extra cost for outdoor enthusiasts?</h2><p>If you’re someone who spends time hiking, doing triathlons, and involved in outdoor activities in extreme temperatures, rugged conditions, and lots of dust and water, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 may be worth the extra cost. Its design makes it more durable and water-resistant (up to 100m) than the other Apple Watch models, and it includes an Action Button for fine-tuning workouts and hikes.</p><h2 id="What-Apple-Watch-is-best-for-kids"><a href="#What-Apple-Watch-is-best-for-kids" class="headerlink" title="What Apple Watch is best for kids?"></a>What Apple Watch is best for kids?</h2><p>While it’s not made specifically with kids in mind, the Apple Watch SE is an excellent smartwatch for older kids with standout features plus parental controls. Along with enabling phone calls and text messages, the Apple Watch SE also tracks your child’s sleep, has state-of-the-art health trackers, features an SOS capability, and pairs with thousands of apps.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-kids-smartwatch/"><strong>The best smartwatches for kids</strong></a></p><p>In addition, you can use Apple’s Family Setup to check your kid’s location, set up shared contacts, implement parental controls like screen time usage, and more.

The temptation to put it back on subsides for the first few days, then over time, I begin to miss <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >what I like about the Apple Watch. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>There’s a reason the Apple Watch is acclaimed as one of the best smartwatches in the world, perhaps <em>the</em> best, depending on who you ask. It’s easily my favorite smartwatch, and there are six reasons why.</p><p>(By the way, these reasons apply to all Apple Watches, whether it’s a <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminum-Detection/dp/B0CHX2F5NJ/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C5c889e19-42e6-4265-a8a1-cf4f70125e0d%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >baseline SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cellular-Smartwatch-Precision-Extra-Long/dp/B0CSVCDCPP?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C5c889e19-42e6-4265-a8a1-cf4f70125e0d%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >fancy new Ultra 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.)</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-A-less-distracting-extension-of-your-iPhone"><a href="#1-A-less-distracting-extension-of-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. A less-distracting extension of your iPhone"></a>1. A less-distracting extension of your iPhone</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>When making this list, I didn’t expect to make this aspect of the Apple Watch my number one reason for using the device. The Apple Watch, when connected to a cellular plan, is an extension of your iPhone. It integrates all the core services of your iPhone and leaves you feeling connected, even when you don’t have your phone on you.</p><p>Here’s a great example: when I took a mini vacation in Florida this past March, I would leave my iPhone in random places, whether in my bedroom, at a table by the pool, or on a towel at the beach. Then, I’d roam around with my Apple Watch and enjoy whatever I was doing, knowing I wouldn’t miss an important text or email.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-set-up-an-apple-watch/" >How to set up an Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>This benefit was especially true on the beach. My brother and I ventured out into the water to toss a frisbee (about knee-high, mind you) and I didn’t want to risk dropping my phone into the gulf, so I left it on the shore and relied on my Apple Watch to deliver notifications, texts, phone calls, and more.</p><p>The watch is also a great way to reduce distractions. When you have your phone on you, the temptation to “open Instagram quickly to see what’s going on” is real. An Apple Watch can’t entertain those same temptations and limits what you can do. Those restrictions may be inconvenient, but it’s also freeing. I love walking around with my watch on instead of carrying my phone, knowing I’ll eventually check the non-important apps on my phone while staying current with what’s really important.</p><p>Of course, your mileage may vary with this experience. Not everyone has or wants a cellular-connected Apple Watch, and all the dings and buzzes you get during the day can be distracting. But for me, having the watch strapped to my wrist and paired with my phone number makes it incredibly easy to cut the reliance on my phone and reduce the temptation to get carried away with all the apps I have installed. It’s great.</p><h2 id="2-A-truly-great-fitness-tracking-experience"><a href="#2-A-truly-great-fitness-tracking-experience" class="headerlink" title="2. A truly great fitness-tracking experience"></a>2. A truly great fitness-tracking experience</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>As I said, I’ve used a lot of smartwatches, so I have a good grasp on what it’s like tracking your fitness with different platforms, and I’ve got to give it to Apple – they have one of the best.</p><p>From the concept of “closing your rings” every day (and the various awards you can earn), to starting fitness competitions with friends and comparing your data, using the Apple Watch and Apple Health for fitness tracking is fun and informative. Plus, all the various sensors built into the Apple Watch help to collect a lot of information about your health and progress.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2/"><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 vs Ultra 2: Which smartwatch should you buy?</strong></a></p><p>Apple’s platform isn’t perfect, mind you. You’ll find better sleep-tracking information on other watches, like the Google Pixel Watch 2, you don’t get any recovery information <em>at all</em>, and the Health app doesn’t proactively tell you whether you’re improving during your fitness journey. Still, for general consumers and fitness enthusiasts, using the Apple Watch for health tracking is a fantastic experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027181/19272" target="_top" id="2027181">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027181" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027181/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Notifications-you-want-to-interact-with"><a href="#3-Notifications-you-want-to-interact-with" class="headerlink" title="3. Notifications you want to interact with"></a>3. Notifications you want to interact with</h2><p>I can’t tell you how many times I’ve used a smartwatch and wanted it to replicate the notification experience of the Apple Watch. From how alerts pop up on your wrist to the sounds and vibrations they make, everyone else should copy what Apple is doing.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-fall-detection-how-and-why-to-enable-it/" >Apple Watch Fall Detection: How and why to enable it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Seriously, the Apple Watch’s notification system is excellent. A gentle tap on the wrist lets you know something has just popped up, while the animation from app icon to notification is fast and clear. You can swipe the alert away with minimal effort, the notification shade is tight yet descriptive, and any notification you dismiss is also dismissed from your phone (a synchronization many Android phones don’t have when paired with a smartwatch). The Apple Watch has the best notifications in the game, bar none.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918698/19272" target="_top" id="1918698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-The-greatest-haptics-on-any-watch"><a href="#4-The-greatest-haptics-on-any-watch" class="headerlink" title="4. The greatest haptics on any watch"></a>4. The greatest haptics on any watch</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>One reason notifications are so good is the Apple Watch’s Taptic Engine, which delivers the most precise haptics on any smartwatch. Apple-engineered lighter vibrations feel like someone’s tapping you on the wrist, while longer buzzes are perfect for alarms and phone calls to grab your attention. Other watches are starting to get kind of close to the Apple Watch’s quality, but Apple still has a huge lead.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-review/" >Apple Watch Series 9 review: Why I’m not settling for the less expensive models in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The feel of haptics on a watch can set the tone for how you perceive the quality of the device. My <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Withings-ScanWatch-Light-Smartwatch-Monitoring/dp/B0CG9RZFLN/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C5c889e19-42e6-4265-a8a1-cf4f70125e0d%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >ScanWatch from Withings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, for example, buzzes like a cheap cell phone from 2014. My <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C797946T/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C5c889e19-42e6-4265-a8a1-cf4f70125e0d%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Galaxy Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>‘s vibrations are stronger and not as buzzy, but feel unnatural. The Apple Watch’s haptics feel the most natural by far, which makes the watch feel great to wear by extension.</p><h2 id="5-Navigating-with-Apple-Maps"><a href="#5-Navigating-with-Apple-Maps" class="headerlink" title="5. Navigating with Apple Maps"></a>5. Navigating with Apple Maps</h2><p>Can you use other smartwatches to navigate to a new destination? You absolutely can. Am I unjustifiably biased towards the Apple Watch for having my favorite navigation experience? Yes, I am.</p><p>So, what makes navigating with Apple Maps on my Apple Watch so good? I like Siri’s more pleasant approach to dictating directions over Google Assistant’s, I enjoy the unique haptics the watch gives you when it’s time to turn left or right (did you know there’s a difference between the two?), I like the layout of the turn-by-turn directions on the watch, and it feels smoother (almost elegant) to use Apple Maps compared to Google Maps.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-maps-vs-google-maps/" >Apple Maps vs. Google Maps, which is best? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If I’m going somewhere I’ve never been, I wear my Apple Watch simply for the navigation perks. Yes, you’ll find a similar experience on other smartwatch platforms, but I like Apple’s the most. Sue me.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/798161/11305" target="_top" id="798161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-798161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i110150.net/i/5597632/798161/11305"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-watchOS-is-the-best-smartwatch-platform"><a href="#6-watchOS-is-the-best-smartwatch-platform" class="headerlink" title="6. watchOS is the best smartwatch platform"></a>6. watchOS is the best smartwatch platform</h2><p>Adam Breeden&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Speaking of other smartwatch platforms, I don’t think it’s any secret that watchOS is by far the best.</p><p>Everything about watchOS is amazing. It’s fast, fluid, easy to use, and has a huge library of third-party apps. The watch faces are simple, clean, and informative, while the new Smart Stack in watchOS 10 is great for quickly glancing at upcoming appointments, the weather, and more.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >The best Apple Watches: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The platform just works the way you’d expect. When paired to your iPhone, so many of your settings will sync with your Apple Watch that it’ll feel like you’ve customized the device without diving into settings. App notifications, Focus modes, Wi-Fi networks, and more all sync with your watch automatically, allowing you to hit the ground running when you strap your Apple Watch to your wrist.</p><p>When I have to test a new Wear OS watch, I immediately miss using watchOS. It feels clunkier and slower, the watch faces aren’t as nice (although there are some decent third-party options), and the apps aren’t as good. If you want the best smartwatch software experience and have to ditch your Android phone for an iPhone, making that switch is worth it. I have friends who have switched to the iPhone simply because the Apple Watch and watchOS are so good.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134501/19576" target="_top" id="2134501">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134501" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134501/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bottom-line"><a href="#Bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom line"></a>Bottom line</h2><p>While the <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminum-Fitness/dp/B0CSVCD314/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C5c889e19-42e6-4265-a8a1-cf4f70125e0d%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> isn’t a perfect smartwatch, many qualities keep me using it.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Apple’s-Vision-of-a-Smart-Home-Introducing-a-Robotic-Helper-of-Tomorrow"><a href="#Apple’s-Vision-of-a-Smart-Home-Introducing-a-Robotic-Helper-of-Tomorrow" class="headerlink" title="Apple’s Vision of a Smart Home: Introducing a Robotic Helper of Tomorrow"></a>Apple’s Vision of a Smart Home: Introducing a Robotic Helper of Tomorrow</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/a4ebaa4d0dcc4a258336cfd2688079f06693e3f2/2024/08/26/006c3acb-66ea-4860-85a4-677cad379348/gettyimages-1284744055.jpg?auto=webp&precrop=2120,1191,x0,y107&width=1280"                      alt="gettyimages-1284744055"                ></p><p>Westend61&#x2F;Getty Images</p><p>We’ve long been fascinated with the idea of having robots around the house to take care of daily chores, freeing us up for more interesting pursuits. Though it would be cool to think that a robot like the Jetsons’ <a class="link"   href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0773919/" >Rosey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is just around the corner, we’re going to have to wait a bit longer for that future.</p><p>Even so, that vision has prompted Apple to investigate the world of robotics to see what would be possible in the short term. The company is currently in the early phases of figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-25/apple-plans-tabletop-robot-while-exploring-mobile-bots-and-humanoid-machines-m09kawex" >how best to use robotics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said in his latest Power On newsletter. If the efforts bear fruit, we could potentially see mobile robots and even humanoid models sometime in the next decade.</p><p>For now, Apple is eyeing a way to add robotics to other devices, an idea the company first cooked up around 2020, according to Gurman. Likely popping up around 2026 or 2027, the first test product in this vein will be a tabletop device with the codename J595. It will feature a large display similar to the iPad with cameras and a base that includes a robotic actuator arm.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/six-levels-of-autonomous-work-how-ai-augments-then-replaces/" >Six levels of autonomous work: How AI augments, then replaces <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>With this robotic arm attached, the device could swivel around to face you if you need to hop on a video call or check out a website for recipes while in the kitchen. This concept could even lead to more advanced machines capable of loading a washing machine or cleaning dirty dishes. </p><p>However, Gurman stressed that these concepts are so far into the future that, for now, they only exist as rough sketches on a whiteboard. </p><p>At this point, Apple’s overarching goal with robotics is to solve some of the limitations and challenges we face with today’s computers and mobile devices. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Gurman noted several examples of these limitations. For instance, you might want to use your computer or mobile phone, but it’s in another location at home or elsewhere. Maybe you want to take photos of a scene or kick off a video chat, but you’re not directly in front of your device. You may want to check or operate something at your home while you’re away. In each of these situations, robotic technology would allow you to control a device from afar.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-i-used-chatgpt-to-scan-170k-lines-of-code-in-seconds-and-save-me-hours-of-detective-work/" >How I used ChatGPT to scan 170k lines of code in seconds and save me hours of detective work <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The road to robotics has gotten a push from the latest developments in <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/" >artificial intelligence (AI) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Any future robotic device would clearly rely on AI for its internal smarts. In a Power On newsletter from April, Gurman said that Apple has been <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-reportedly-exploring-ai-powered-home-robots-including-these-two-products/" >exploring the development <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of personal robots. Powered by embedded AI, such a product would act like a mobile assistant that follows you around the house. </p><p>Of course, even a robot needs a personality. Though Siri is the voice of the iPhone, iPad, and other Apple products, the company is developing a different technology for its robots. Gurman <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/#link={" >said <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the new interface, based on generative AI, would eventually run on the tabletop unit and other Apple robotic devices.</p><p>Beyond AI, Apple could also fine-tune robotic devices through its expertise in sensors, advanced silicon, engineering, and batteries, Gurman explained. Even further, the company might be able to help a robotic assistant navigate by applying its knowledge of how to map spaces around devices.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-talks-ai-rust-adoption-and-why-the-linux-kernel-is-the-only-thing-that-matters/" >Linus Torvalds talks AI, Rust adoption, and why the Linux kernel is ‘the only thing that matters’ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Still, success is far from guaranteed. Apple had been working on a self-driving car project for almost ten years. However, that project faced a number of obstacles, eventually forcing the company to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-just-killed-its-electric-car-project-shifting-focus-to-generative-ai/#link={" >shut it down <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> earlier this year. Apple doesn’t win at every attempt at a new product – no matter how many people and other resources are thrown at it.</p><p>Yes, you can already get robots that <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/robot-vacuum-deals/" >roam the house <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> today. But your average contemporary robot is a simple device, more of a novelty than an advanced mechanical person. As Gurman notes, home robots would have to surmount technical challenges in order to truly succeed – like learning how to navigate the average multi-level house, not just one level the way a smart vacuum can.</p><p>As with any new and advanced technology, the first robotic devices will cost Apple a lot to build (and customers a lot to buy). Though the company has already brought in top robotics experts, it will need more engineers and other talent to create products that will both work and sell. </p><p>Still, if Apple can succeed with robotics, the company will have found another way to potentially improve life for those of us who always wished we had our own personal Rosey.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/"  title="20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really">20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/"  title="Want a programming job?

It’s easy to fit onto an iPhone (I don’t know about you, but I’ve struggled to get some phone cases on or off) and the buttons are separate pieces molded into the plastic, so they have a more tactile feel than ones that are just part of the case.</p><p>The port cover on the bottom prevents stuff from getting into the USB-C port, and all the cutouts line up perfectly with the features of the iPhone.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-transfer-data-from-android-to-an-iphone/" >How to transfer data from Android to an iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I also like the bumper molded into the case that protects the cameras. That feature is nice because cameras hanging out the front can be vulnerable. There are also bumpers on the front of the case to protect the display, both when you put the handset face down on the surface or when you drop it.</p><p>The effective camera bumper.</p><p>Adrian Kingsley-Hughes&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The case also comes with a wrist lanyard. I don’t use lanyards because I find they catch on things, but I know some people find them handy in preventing accidentally dropping or misplacing their phone. </p><p>Most of all though, I love the glow-in-the-dark color. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-accessory/" >MagSafe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ring on the back glows, as do the button elements and the lanyard, giving your device a soft glow that makes it easier to find in the dark or when it’s buried at the bottom of a bag. This is not the sort of glow that keeps you awake at night.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-gan-everything-you-need-to-know-about-gallium-nitride-charging-tech/"><strong>What is GaN? Everything you need to know about gallium nitride-based charging tech</strong></a></p><p>This case can also take quite a beating. In the few months that I’ve owned the iPhone 15 Pro Max, I’ve dropped it quite a few times, and I feel like some of those drops could have been bad news if it wasn’t for this case. I’ve dropped it on rocks, concrete, and even seen it slide down hills and bump down stairs. Thankfully, the case means there’s not a scratch on my phone.</p><p>For the record, I’m using a screen protector for added durability. I think this case is certainly one of the best I’ve tested in a long time, and the first in quite a while that I felt compelled to write about.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ZDNET’s-buying-advice"><a href="#ZDNET’s-buying-advice" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET’s buying advice"></a>ZDNET’s buying advice</h2><p>I know some people say you don’t need a case for your iPhone, and that may very well be the case (no pun intended). Nevertheless, I think a case gives you extra protection in the event of a fall or drop and some additional grip – modern smartphones do, after all, have the grip of a wet bar of soap. I also think a case is a nice way to personalize your phone. Since the iPhone is something that people drop several hundred dollars on, I think giving it some extra protection isn’t a bad thing.</p><p>My testing suggests cases don’t get much better than the <a

With the new OS version, you can directly customize, move, and rearrange the sections and icons in Control Center, letting you set up multiple screens that are easily accessible with just a swipe. Adding a new control is also simpler and more intuitive. Here’s how this works.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-ios-18-features-ive-been-using-on-android-for-a-while/" >5 iOS 18 features I’ve been using on Android for a while <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>With previous versions of iOS, you’d have to head to Settings to customize Control Center, choosing which controls to add or remove. With iOS 18, you can tweak and manage the icons directly in Control Center itself. This means you can visually add, remove, and otherwise organize the different controls.</p><p>If you want to follow along, you’ll need to install the iOS 18 public beta on an iPhone. Though the public beta should be more stable than the earlier developer beta, you may want to set this up on a spare iPhone if one is available.

You can create as many as 15 screens, though you’ll probably want to stop before you reach that number.</p><p>Screenshot by Lance Whitney&#x2F;ZDNET</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997722/19272" target="_top" id="1997722">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997722" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997722/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Power-down-from-Control-Center"><a href="#7-Power-down-from-Control-Center" class="headerlink" title="7.

There’s a deluge of new features on both the hardware and the software side, so we don’t blame you if you’re struggling to break it all down. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-just-gave-me-a-compelling-reason-to-buy-the-smaller-iphone-16-pro-over-the-max-this-year/" >Apple just gave me a compelling reason to buy the smaller iPhone 16 Pro over the Max this year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But which features will actually have the most impact on iPhone enthusiasts?

This time around, both the 16 Pro and the 16 Pro Max are getting the high-end zoom capability. This choice means the camera is essentially the same on the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, leaving other features to differentiate the two models. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134500/19576" target="_top" id="2134500">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134500" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134500/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-The-camera-control"><a href="#2-The-camera-control" class="headerlink" title="2.

The camera control</h2><p>Screenshot by Kayla Solino&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>One of the new features getting a lot of attention is the camera control button coming to the entire lineup of iPhone 16 models. Designed to operate similarly to the shutter button on a DSLR, it’s a physical button on the bottom right side of the phone with touch-capacitive capabilities that responds to swipes and soft presses. </p><p>For example, a light press on the button focuses on the subject, and a harder press snaps the photo. Additionally, swiping on the button switches between photo and video modes or zoom in and out. Clicking and holding will take a video. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-apples-new-a18-chipsets-make-the-iphone-16-models-worth-upgrading-to/" >Why Apple’s new A18 chipsets make the iPhone 16 models worth upgrading to <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The camera control button is available on all iPhone 16 models, but it’s when paired with the advanced camera and the A18 Pro processor on the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max that Apple aims to provide a more seamless user experience that sets the Pro and Pro Max apart.

Siri’s much-needed makeover</h2><p>The iOS 18 beta running on iPhone 15 Pro.</p><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>No offense to one of the OG voice assistants, but Siri has needed a makeover for a while now. When Apple’s virtual assistant was first released in 2010, it set the stage for the ecosystem of virtual assistant technology. But fast-forward almost 15 years later and the market is full of competing AI models with capabilities that, let’s be honest, blow Siri out of the water. </p><p>Well, the time has finally come. Apple unveiled a ton of new functionality for Siri, and it’s powered by Apple Intelligence. The new Siri includes conversational context so it can take cues from what you just told it, as well as the ability to finally actually make multi-step actions on your behalf like adding photos to specific albums and sharing them. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-compared-which-iphone-should-you-buy-today/" >Every iPhone 16 model compared: Which iPhone should you buy today? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Beyond Siri, we have <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-adds-visual-intelligence-its-answer-to-google-lens-to-the-iphone-16-camera/" >Visual Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which allows multi-modal AI via the camera, similar to what we’ve seen across other AI models this year. Apple Intelligence will start with a live beta in October in the US, with additional countries in December, and additional languages next year. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130870/7443" target="_top" id="2130870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Upgraded-chipset-for-the-AI-age"><a href="#4-Upgraded-chipset-for-the-AI-age" class="headerlink" title="4.

With 17% more memory bandwidth, the A18 Pro chip is up to 15% faster than the A17 Pro and uses 20% less power in the process. Additionally, the advanced display engine on the A18 Pro powers unique features like ProMotion and the always-on display.</p><p>The 3mm technology has smaller, more efficient transistors, and constitutes a big step forward in hardware that’s geared to handle generative AI.

The iPhone has hovered around the same size for quite a few generations now, and this bump-up in size could indicate a change in the direction they’re going in. </p><h4 id="Featured-reviews"><a href="#Featured-reviews" class="headerlink" title="Featured reviews"></a>Featured reviews</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-best-smart-thermostats-ive-tested-is-not-made-by-ecobee-or-amazon/"  title="One of the best smart thermostats I&#39;ve tested is not made by Ecobee or Amazon">One of the best smart thermostats I’ve tested is not made by Ecobee or Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-upgraded-to-the-iphone-16-plus-heres-why-its-the-model-most-people-should-buy/"  title="I demoed Apple&#39;s standard iPhone 16 and didn&#39;t envy the Pro models at all">I demoed Apple’s standard iPhone 16 and didn’t envy the Pro models at all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-lenovos-windows-laptop-that-doubles-as-an-android-tablet-and-it-has-so-much-potential/"  title="This Lenovo laptop that transforms into an Android tablet is the most clever device I&#39;ve tested">This Lenovo laptop that transforms into an Android tablet is the most clever device I’ve tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-apple-watch-series-10-the-oura-ring-is-my-go-to-health-tracker-for-one-obvious-reason/"  title="Forget Apple Watch Series 10: The Oura Ring is my go-to health tracker for one obvious reason">Forget Apple Watch Series 10: The Oura Ring is my go-to health tracker for one obvious reason <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-best-smart-thermostats-ive-tested-is-not-made-by-ecobee-or-amazon/"  title="One of the best smart thermostats I&#39;ve tested is not made by Ecobee or Amazon">One of the best smart thermostats I’ve tested is not made by Ecobee or Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-upgraded-to-the-iphone-16-plus-heres-why-its-the-model-most-people-should-buy/"  title="I demoed Apple&#39;s standard iPhone 16 and didn&#39;t envy the Pro models at all">I demoed Apple’s standard iPhone 16 and didn’t envy the Pro models at all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-lenovos-windows-laptop-that-doubles-as-an-android-tablet-and-it-has-so-much-potential/"  title="This Lenovo laptop that transforms into an Android tablet is the most clever device I&#39;ve tested">This Lenovo laptop that transforms into an Android tablet is the most clever device I’ve tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-apple-watch-series-10-the-oura-ring-is-my-go-to-health-tracker-for-one-obvious-reason/"  title="Forget Apple Watch Series 10: The Oura Ring is my go-to health tracker for one obvious reason">Forget Apple Watch Series 10: The Oura Ring is my go-to health tracker for one obvious reason <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-premium-mac-edition-screens-and-sound-syncing/"><u>[New] In 2024, Premium Mac Edition Screens and Sound Syncing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-entry-level-insights-navigating-hd-and-uhd-video-standards/"><u>[Updated] Entry-Level Insights Navigating HD & UHD Video Standards</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-next-gen-screen-capture-tools-ultra-fast-action/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Next-Gen Screen Capture Tools -

The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is larger than the Series 9, but the titanium case helps keep the weight down, and it is far lighter than competing sports watches. </p><p>Apple’s WatchOS 10 launched with APIs for custom workouts and we are starting to see third parties release new versions of applications to support this advanced training functionality.

With this feature, you can do everything from answering calls, snoozing your morning alarm, playing or pausing media, ending timers, and more.</p><p><strong>\</strong>With the new Series 9, you no longer need an active connection for Siri, since the watch can now process requests without it. Not to mention, due to Crash Detection, the watch can also detect when you are involved in a car crash and will connect you to emergency services. </p><p><strong>Also</strong>: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-top-4-features-that-warrant-the-upgrade-from-series-8/"><strong>Apple Watch Series 9: Top 4 features that warrant the upgrade from Series 8</strong></a></p><p>Among other features, the Series 9 is excellent for daily users, and athletes looking to track their health journey. Former University of San Diego track athlete Emma Clark said she replaced her Garmin Forerunner with an Apple Watch when she retired from competition. </p><p>“For someone who lives an active lifestyle but is no longer competing competitively, it makes the most sense to have a watch integrated with important things on my phone, like my calendar and messages,” Clark said.</p><p><strong>Apple Watch Series 9</strong> <strong>tech specs: Display:</strong> 396 x 484 pixels OLED | <strong>Battery life:</strong> 18 hours | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 45 x 38 x 10.7mm | <strong>Weight:</strong> 38.8 g (Al) | <strong>Water&#x2F;Dust resistance:</strong> 50m with IP6X | <strong>LTE cellular option:</strong> Yes </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel%5Fwatch%5F3" >View now at Google Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-45mm-Smartwatch/dp/B0D91268TH/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d8072d0-91a7-48a4-af36-a80107f97e0b%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Two sizes to choose from</li><li>Personalized running workouts</li><li>Advanced safety features</li><li>Minimalist, elegant design</li><li>Improved battery life</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Not built for rugged adventures</li></ul><h2 id="Google-Pixel-Watch-3"><a href="#Google-Pixel-Watch-3" class="headerlink" title="Google Pixel Watch 3"></a>Google Pixel Watch 3</h2><h3 id="Best-Google-smartwatch"><a href="#Best-Google-smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Best Google smartwatch"></a>Best Google smartwatch</h3><p>Google’s third-generation Pixel Watch 3 is sure to please the masses with two size options, improved displays, and software enhancements that provide a richer user experience. This watch integrates several Fitbit features, including improved heart rate sensors and GPS tracking, making it secretly the best watch available for both Fitbit <em>and</em> Google Pixel fans.</p><p>One of the best functions of the Pixel Watch 3 that even beats out the Apple Watch is the focus on safety. While the Apple Watch can appear in your Find My application, and you can share your location with family and friends, that’s a passive setting that requires people to physically check the app to find you. The Pixel 3’s Safety Check feature allows you to set a check-in timer whenever you’re moving from point A to B and want your emergency contacts to be notified if anything goes wrong – the most reliable feature I’ve seen on any wearable I’ve tested. It also supports immediate emergency alerts&#x2F;SOS and fall detection alerts, similar to the latest Apple Watches. </p><p>The new <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-overlooked-pixel-watch-3-feature-could-save-your-life/" >Loss of Pulse Detection feature, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> coming later to select countries, is sure to save lives and could have had a direct impact on my family life if it had been around a few years ago.</p><p><strong>Review</strong>: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hands-on-with-the-pixel-watch-3-the-three-features-google-got-right/"><strong>Hands-on with the Pixel Watch 3: The three features Google got right</strong></a></p><p>Bottom line: If you’re a Fitbit fan and are looking for the latest and greatest Fitbit in a watch form factor, then the Google Pixel Watch 3 is the wearable for you. If you also enjoy Google’s take on wearables and want years of updates, then this is the watch to consider.</p><p><strong>Google Pixel Watch 3 tech specs: Display:</strong> 1.2-inch (41mm) and 1.45-inch (45mm) AMOLED | <strong>Battery life:</strong> 24 hours with AOD | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 41 x 41 x 12.3mm and 45 x 45 x 12.3mm | <strong>Weight:</strong> 31 g (without band) and 37 g | <strong>Water&#x2F;Dust resistance:</strong> 5 ATM&#x2F;IP68 | <strong>LTE cellular option:</strong> Yes </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartwatch-Wellness-Tracking-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YL96ND/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d8072d0-91a7-48a4-af36-a80107f97e0b%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Lightweight titanium casing</li><li>Sapphire glass AMOLED display</li><li>Advanced safety features</li><li>Large capacity battery Google Wear OS app support</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Large size not suitable for smaller wrists</li><li>Blood pressure certification taking much longer than advertised</li></ul><h2 id="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra"></a>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</h2><h3 id="Best-Samsung-smartwatch-for-outdoor-adventurers"><a href="#Best-Samsung-smartwatch-for-outdoor-adventurers" class="headerlink" title="Best Samsung smartwatch for outdoor adventurers"></a>Best Samsung smartwatch for outdoor adventurers</h3><p>Apple took a shot across the bow of serious GPS sports watch brands with the Apple Watch Ultra series, and now Samsung joins the party with the large Galaxy Watch Ultra. Samsung branded it the same way as Apple, along with a familiar orange button and waterproof silicone band.

She said it helps her accurately track running distance and pace while she trains for her next half-marathon.</p><p>With an Apple Watch, iPhone users can answer phone calls, receive notifications, and send messages from the convenience of their wrist.

It also monitors my heart rate, which is nice” he said.</p><p>The next generation of the Apple Watch SE contains many features from the Apple Watch Series 8. You gain Crash Detection technology, meaning the watch can detect if you’ve been in an accident and contact first responders. </p><p>It also features the enhanced Workout app, giving you access to custom workouts and advanced metrics like heart rate zones, stride, length, and vertical oscillation.

It runs the latest Zepp OS 3.0 operating system, built for a lean and mean experience.</p><p>It’s tough to beat the low $220 price, and I continue to push the watch to see where the flaws are that could justify such a low price, but they don’t exist. The Amazfit Balance has a brilliant AMOLED display, integrated mic and speaker, GPS, various advanced health&#x2F;wellness sensors, and a battery life that lasts up to two weeks between charges. The battery life alone is something modern smartwatches cannot match and if you want to charge your watch just twice a month rather than every other day, then you might want to consider this watch.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-i-wear-this-220-smartwatch-even-after-testing-garmin-and-apple-watches/"><strong>Why I wear this $220 smartwatch even after testing Garmin and Apple watches</strong></a></p><p>Amazfit provides the Zepp smartphone application that provides an exhaustive experience to track every detail of the data captured by the various sensors. The one flaw is that the application may be overwhelming for some users and thankfully, Amazfit continues to refine and simplify the application to make it more useful for Amazfit Balance owners.</p><p>Phone calls sound good and it is convenient to make and accept calls from your wrist when your phone is secured in a pocket or your backpack.

I picked up the LTE model that provides cellular connectivity independently from my phone, but when paired with the Galaxy S24 Ultra, it’s a perfect combination of elegance and power.

Several factors will help you quickly narrow down available candidates, so let’s take a closer look and help you select the best smartwatch for you.</p><ul><li><strong>Primary smartphone</strong>: Start by looking at the phone in your hand. If you own an iPhone, then you can consider an Apple Watch, or a watch running an operating system that is not powered by Google’s Wear OS. If you own an Android smartphone, forget about buying an Apple Watch, as they do not even work with an iPad or Apple computer, let alone your Android. Android users can consider Google Wear OS watches, as well as those running a real-time operating system like Amazfit offers.</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> Most smartwatches are priced in the $250 to $400 range, so there is not a lot of variance in price, especially if you use your smartwatch daily and want a reliable watch. Apple offers the high-end Apple Watch Ultra 2, while there are some specialized Google Wear OS and Garmin watches that can cost more than $1,000.</li><li><strong>Battery life:</strong> Expect your smartwatch to last a full day and night, so you can track your sleep and then charge it while you get ready for work. A few new smartwatches are now easily lasting 48 hours between charging, with some pushing that another day or two so we are seeing improvements in battery life.</li><li><strong>Cellular connectivity:</strong> While smartwatches serve as companions to our smartphones, some models support cellular connectivity. If you buy one of these then you will need a watch line with your carrier, but these are typically $10 per month. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra include LTE support by default, but you are not required to enable cellular service. Cellular capability is great for those who want to leave their phones behind and still remain connected for communications, application usage, and safety.</li></ul><h2 id="How-we-test-smartwatches"><a href="#How-we-test-smartwatches" class="headerlink" title="How we test smartwatches"></a>How we test smartwatches</h2><p>All of the smartwatches included in this list were chosen based on how they performed when <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-smartwatches-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tested in the real world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by the ZDNET team. When we test smartwatches, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.</p><ul><li><strong>Daily wear</strong>: We wear the smartwatch as our primary watch with communications, applications, and other elements being tested as if it was our only smartwatch.</li><li><strong>Application selection and performance</strong>: One aspect that makes smartwatches different than standard watches is the support for applications. We load up the watch with apps and then test the performance and functionality of those applications. Apple excels in the area of third party application support with Google’s Play Store improving each year. Garmin, Amazfit, and others also are expanding the number and selection of apps available on watches.</li><li><strong>Workouts</strong>: Smartwatch makers have embraced health and fitness so we take our smartwatch out for running with GPS, rowing on the Hydrow, biking on trails, and walking with the family. GPS and heart rate data is tracked and then we evaluate the accuracy against proven GPS sports watches.</li><li><strong>Sleep and activity tracking:</strong> Sleep tracking has improved with smartwatches over time and we evaluate them as compared to smart rings and other watches. Nighttime is also a good time to charge your smartwatch, so you may choose not to use your watch to track sleep so your watch can serve faithfully all day and into the night.</li></ul><p>For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-smartwatches-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >smartwatch testing methodology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043617/7443" target="_top" id="2043617">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043617" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043617/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/1995803/22899" target="_top" id="1995803">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-1995803" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/1995803/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-there-any-smartwatches-I-should-avoid"><a href="#Are-there-any-smartwatches-I-should-avoid" class="headerlink" title="Are there any smartwatches I should avoid?"></a>Are there any smartwatches I should avoid?</h2><p>There are many reasons why a person might want a smartwatch, so depending on your needs, it’s hard to recommend watches that will satisfy everyone. However, based on my testing, there are a couple of smartwatches that you may want to leave off your list of considerations as you conduct your research.</p><p>Fossil has been offering smartwatches for a long time, and I still have a working Fossil Wrist PDA that is powered by Palm OS and has a tiny stylus. For the past few years, Fossil has been making Google Wear OS-powered smartwatches and offering a fairly compelling option with some unique styles. However, in January 2024 Fossil Group announced that it would no longer be releasing smartwatches, with the last Gen 6 model released in 2021. You can still find some Fossil watches available, and Fossil Group stated that they will continue to update the watches for the next few years, but be careful when you are considering one of these watches.</p><p>There was a great promise with a luxury Wear OS watch in 2022 when Montblanc released the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/montblanc-summit-3-review/" >Summit 3 smartwatch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. While we provided a preliminary review as we looked for a future update that was supposed to add some core functionality, that update never came, and the watch sits idly by running the same older version of Wear OS on a processor that is now a couple of generations old. It’s a lovely luxury watch so if you want a basic smartwatch with those good looks, maybe you can find one on sale. </p><h2 id="How-do-I-set-up-my-smartwatch"><a href="#How-do-I-set-up-my-smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="How do I set up my smartwatch?"></a>How do I set up my smartwatch?</h2><p>Watches in our list, other than Google Wear OS or Apple Watch models, are typically set up by downloading and installing the associated companion smartphone application and then pairing the watch with that application. Some Google Wear OS watches also use this method since those models have additional applications beyond what Google provides on Pixel Watch.</p><p>If you own a Google Wear OS smartwatch, primarily from Google or Samsung, then the Google Watch or Samsung Wearable application must first be installed on your Android smartphone. Google Pixel Watch models also now have Fitbit integrated into the watch, but to take advantage of this vast health&#x2F;fitness ecosystem the Fitbit smartphone application is also required. Samsung also has its Samsung Health application so pairing and setting up a Google Wear OS watch is a bit of a process that generally requires two or more smartphone applications.</p><p>Apple Watch users turn on the watch and then follow the prompts to pair it to an iPhone, often with the iPhone camera scanning an image that appears on the Apple Watch face. Apple has the Watch smartphone application preloaded on the iPhone so set up is quick and easy. If you had a previous Apple Watch then you can also have all of that data synced over to a new model, which makes upgrading Apple Watch models one of the experiences that keep people upgrading on a regular basis.</p><h2 id="Can-you-use-a-Samsung-or-Google-watch-with-an-iPhone"><a href="#Can-you-use-a-Samsung-or-Google-watch-with-an-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Can you use a Samsung or Google watch with an iPhone?"></a>Can you use a Samsung or Google watch with an iPhone?</h2><p>Google Wear OS watches used to work with both Android and iPhone devices, but the new Wear OS 4 and later watches from Samsung and Google only support Android smartphones. iPhone users should stick with the Apple Watch, while Android phone users should seriously consider a Google Pixel Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch model.</p><p>Garmin, Amazfit, and Withings watches work flawlessly with both Android and iPhone devices.</p><h2 id="Can-I-text-from-a-smartwatch"><a href="#Can-I-text-from-a-smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Can I text from a smartwatch?"></a>Can I text from a smartwatch?</h2><p>You absolutely can! However, most of their screens are too small to type on, so you’ll compose messages with speech-to-text or other dictation functions or choose from several generic, auto-generated responses. </p><p>Garmin watches support quick-response text messaging via a connected Android smartphone. Apple restricts third-party text messaging on the iPhone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1374820">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374820.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1374820">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374820.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1374820%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1374820/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Can-you-use-a-cellular-Apple-Watch-as-a-standalone-device"><a href="#Can-you-use-a-cellular-Apple-Watch-as-a-standalone-device" class="headerlink" title="Can you use a cellular Apple Watch as a standalone device?"></a>Can you use a cellular Apple Watch as a standalone device?</h2><p>While you can leave your iPhone at home while you run, go to the store, or stroll on the beach, you must have an iPhone turned on and connected to the internet at this other location. This is one reason why connecting to an iPhone and switching to an Android makes the Apple Watch useless with an Android phone.</p><p>After initial setup, a cellular-enabled Samsung Galaxy Watch or Google Pixel Watch can act as a stand-alone mobile device. With the latest Galaxy Watch 7, Watch Ultra, or Pixel Watch 3 running Wear OS, many more apps can be used on the go, so you can leave the phone behind in most cases.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-hot-new-features-in-the-latest-smartwatches"><a href="#What-are-the-hot-new-features-in-the-latest-smartwatches" class="headerlink" title="What are the hot new features in the latest smartwatches?"></a>What are the hot new features in the latest smartwatches?</h2><p>Health and fitness tracking have been the areas with the most innovations and improvements in the last few years. While these watches are not medical devices, they have sensors, algorithms, and applications that help you track trends in your heart rate, stress levels, and blood oxygen levels, even allowing you to detect when ovulation occurs. You can use it as a basic ECG to check if further investigation is needed. The latest Galaxy Watch can also measure your body composition; testing indicates it matches other methods reasonably well.</p><p>These smartwatches can also serve as capable GPS sports watches to track the details of your outdoor activities. Exercise guidance is provided on the watch with connected health applications on your smartphone so you can keep track of your progress, too.</p><h2 id="What’s-the-future-of-wearable-technology"><a href="#What’s-the-future-of-wearable-technology" class="headerlink" title="What’s the future of wearable technology?"></a>What’s the future of wearable technology?</h2><p>We will likely continue to see expansion of the health and wellness features in smartwatches, but what’s next on the horizon for these wrist-based computing devices? With increased connectivity and widespread adoption, smartwatches will likely become more integral to our daily lives. This may include connectivity to other devices in our lives. For example, as you approach your electronic door lock, your paired smartwatch could unlock your door so you can keep both hands on your groceries or luggage when you return home. </p><p>People also regularly have video calls with family and friends, not just coworkers, so future smartwatches may integrate tiny cameras so that users can communicate in this same manner while out and about.</p><p>In addition, as AI continues to integrate into our lives, having this technology available in our watches should help provide data faster and more accurately than simple web search queries that we may carry out with Siri or Google Assistant.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123509/26400" target="_top" id="2123509">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123509" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123509/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What’s-the-best-smartwatch-for-health-monitoring"><a href="#What’s-the-best-smartwatch-for-health-monitoring" class="headerlink" title="What’s the best smartwatch for health monitoring?"></a>What’s the best smartwatch for health monitoring?</h2><p>All smartwatches today integrate advanced heart rate sensors, temperature sensors, blood oxygen sensors, and more, as our health data is tracked 24&#x2F;7. Samsung led the way with its smartwatch health monitoring, which includes body composition, advanced sleep tracking, ECG, blood oxygen, running power, and even blood pressure measurements.</p><p>Google acquired Fitbit, and now the Fitbit ecosystem is deeply incorporated into the Pixel Watch experience. This includes helpful insights, personalized running workouts based on your sleep, activity, and lifestyle, and more practical and helpful feedback to optimize your health and wellness.</p><p>Apple has advanced its health monitoring technology, and the upcoming watchOS 11 will bring even more capability with detailed data measurements in its Vitals application. Training Load will also be coming with this next version of the operating system, challenging the likes of Garmin, Coros, and Polar with this advanced fitness metric.</p><h2 id="Can-smartwatches-monitor-blood-sugar"><a href="#Can-smartwatches-monitor-blood-sugar" class="headerlink" title="Can smartwatches monitor blood sugar?"></a>Can smartwatches monitor blood sugar?</h2><p>The FDA released a <a class="link"   href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/do-not-use-smartwatches-or-smart-rings-measure-blood-glucose-levels-fda-safety-communication" >safety communication <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the public that advises consumers not to use smartwatches or smart rings that claim to measure blood glucose levels without piercing the skin.

However, they’re not as accurate as a blood pressure monitor, so you shouldn’t rely solely on your smartwatch to monitor your heart or general health.</p><p>Samsung provides blood pressure monitoring via its Galaxy Watch models in countries outside the US, with rumors that Apple may launch watches supporting this functionality in 2024.</p><h2 id="Should-I-choose-a-smartwatch-based-on-compatibility"><a href="#Should-I-choose-a-smartwatch-based-on-compatibility" class="headerlink" title="Should I choose a smartwatch based on compatibility?"></a>Should I choose a smartwatch based on compatibility?</h2><p>Eric Potter, USA weightlifting Level 1 Coach and Performance Coach at <a class="link"   href="https://www.future.co/" >Future <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Fitness, encourages people to choose a smartwatch based on compatibility, recommending an Apple Watch for iPhone users and a Samsung Galaxy Watch for Android fans.

Adjust Video Color Settings or Change Output Settings</h3><p>Many Nvidia card users have encountered the washed-out color issue when playing videos in VLC. If you have been troubled with the same problem, then walk along with the guide below to correct the black levels of your video:</p><p>▪ Type <strong>Nvidia Control Panel</strong> in the Windows search bar and open it.<br> ▪ Go to <strong>Advanced Settings &gt; Video</strong>.<br> ▪ Then click <strong>Adjust video color settings</strong> and check the option “<strong>with the NVIDIA settings</strong>”.<br> ▪ Below the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, change the <strong>Dynamic range</strong> to <strong><em>full (0-255)</em></strong>.<br> ▪ Then restart VLC to put it into effect. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-04.webp"                      alt="Adjust Video Color Settings"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-04-04.webp"                      alt="Adjust Video Color Settings"                > </p><p>If you fail to bring up the Nvidia Control Panel or the above method doesn’t make any improvement, the issue might be with the use of YUV, which is a television standard. You can keep going with the following steps to cancel it: </p><p>▪ Start VLC and go to <strong>Tools &gt; Preferences</strong>.<br> ▪ Switch to <strong>Video</strong> and select <strong>DirectX (DirectDraw) video output</strong>.<br> ▪ Then uncheck the <strong>Hardware YUV-&gt;RGB conversions</strong> option.<br> ▪ Don’t forget to restart the VLC player. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-05.webp"                      alt="Disable the Hardware YUV Option in VLC"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880927/19272" target="_top" id="1880927">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880927" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880927/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-05-05.webp"                      alt="Disable the Hardware YUV Option in VLC"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557747/17382" target="_top" id="1557747">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557747" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557747/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Here is another workaround you can try to enhance the output video quality in VLC: </p><p>▪ Start VLC and enter the <strong>Preference</strong> settings.<br> ▪ Choose to show <strong>All</strong> settings.<br> ▪ On the left panel, click <strong>Video</strong> and double-click <strong>Output modules</strong>.<br> ▪ Choose <strong>Direct3D11</strong>.<br> ▪ Then on the right side of the window, select <strong>Super Resolution</strong> from the <strong>Video Upscaliing Mode</strong> drop-down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-06.webp"                      alt="VLC Change Output Settings"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-06-06.webp"                      alt="VLC Change Output Settings"                > </p><h3 id="4-Activate-the-RTX-Video-Super-Resolution-Feature-in-VLC"><a href="#4-Activate-the-RTX-Video-Super-Resolution-Feature-in-VLC" class="headerlink" title="4.

Activate the RTX Video Super Resolution Feature in VLC</h3><p>With the support for RTX Video Super Resolution, VLC does help increase the clarity and sharpness of videos, but it is far from being a game-changer. And some users even reported an instant crash when enabling this feature in VLC. But it is still worth trying. Before activating it, please ensure you have installed the newest VLC (3.0.19 or later) and have a PC running GeForce RTX 30- and 40-series graphics cards.</p><p>▪ Open the Nvidia Control Panel.<br> ▪ Navigate to <strong>Video &gt; Adjust video image settings</strong>.<br> ▪ In the RTX video enhancement box, check the <strong>Super resolution</strong> option.<br> ▪ Select the desired level of upscaling from the <strong>Quality</strong> drop-down options. <strong>Level 4</strong> delivers the best performance, but also requires the most GPU resources.<br> ▪ Finally, apply the changes. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-07.webp"                      alt="Activate the RTX Video Super Resolution"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-07-07.webp"                      alt="Activate the RTX Video Super Resolution"                > </p><h2 id="Part-2-Try-Easier-Alternative-to-Improve-Video-Quality"><a href="#Part-2-Try-Easier-Alternative-to-Improve-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Rather, Apple is now moving further into AI language models. </p><p>Last Thursday, Apple released <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/apple/DCLM-7B" >DCLM-Baseline-7B <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a 7 billion parameter language model, on Hugging Face. The model is part of the DataComp for Language Models (DCLM) benchmark, an initiative to improve the quality of training datasets for language models.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-try-gpt-4o-mini-3-ways-to-access-the-smarter-cheaper-ai-model-and-2-are-free/" >Want to try GPT-4o mini? 3 ways to access the smarter, cheaper AI model - and 2 are free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>At 7 billion parameters, this model is comparable to popular models such as Llama 2, Gemma, and more. When tested on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark against popular models around the same size, DCLM-Baseline-7B performed competitively, even outperforming Mistral 7B, as seen below. </p><p>Apple&#x2F;Hugging Face</p><p>Despite its impressive performance, one of the DCLM-Baseline-7B’s biggest standouts is that the model is truly open-sourced, with “open data, open weight models, open training code,” as highlighted by Vaishaal Shankar, a research scientist at Apple. </p><blockquote><p>We have released our DCLM models on huggingface! To our knowledge these are by far the best performing truly open-source models (open data, open weight models, open training code) 1&#x2F;5</p><p>— Vaishaal Shankar (@Vaishaal) <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/Vaishaal/status/1813956553042711006?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" >July 18, 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></blockquote><p>Many are commending Apple for this approach as it allows other researchers and developers to build on the models and further grow advancements in the space. The model was trained on the <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlfoundations/dclm-baseline-1.0" >DCLM-BASELINE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> data, combined with <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/starcoderdata" >StarCoder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="http://proofpile2/" >ProofPile2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>data, to reach proficiency in other tasks such as coding and math.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-can-be-updated-to-apples-new-ios-18-public-beta-and-which-ones-cant/" >Every iPhone model that can be updated to Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones can’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In addition to releasing DCLM-Baseline-7B, model weights, training code, and dataset, Apple also included a powerful 1.4 billion parameter version in the package. </p><p>This isn’t Apple’s first go-around with AI models, having released others such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-model-can-understand-your-home-screen-and-supercharge-siri/" >Ferret-UI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a multimodal large language model (MLLM), and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-claims-its-on-device-ai-system-realm-substantially-outperforms-gpt-4/" >Reference Resolution As Language Modeling (ReALM) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a conversational AI system.

The idea of two independent earbuds that stayed in sync, were easy to use, and had respectable battery life was considered nothing more than a dream. </p><p>Fast forward to 2021, and Apple’s AirPods have spurred the creation of completely wireless buds from nearly every major tech company – and even smaller ones. For its part, Apple has released the AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and, more recently, the 3rd generation AirPods. The newest model boasts a completely new design and new features that were once reserved for its more expensive AirPods. </p><p>At $179, the base model AirPods saw a small price increase, with Apple keeping the 2nd generation AirPods in the lineup at $129. </p><p><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Caa3ef441-a9e9-4ea2-9497-3481695a10b8%7Cdtp&dtb=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/2021/11/09/7f658c09-25b4-49fd-b36c-477add905a80/airpods-third-gen-2.jpg"                      alt="airpods-third-gen-2.jpg"                > Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) 4.5 &#x2F; 5  Very good</a> </p><h4 id="pros-and-cons"><a href="#pros-and-cons" class="headerlink" title="pros and cons"></a>pros and cons</h4><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Long battery life</li><li>Solid sound quality</li><li>Multiple charging options</li><li>Spatial Audio</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>No noise cancellation</li><li>Some will have an issue with the fit</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Caa3ef441-a9e9-4ea2-9497-3481695a10b8%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >$175 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="A-familiar-but-different-design"><a href="#A-familiar-but-different-design" class="headerlink" title="A familiar, but different design"></a>A familiar, but different design</h2><p>Left: Apple’s newest AirPods. Right: AirPods Pro</p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>Apple’s standard AirPods have had the same design since their debut in 2016, but rumors circulated for the last year that the 3rd generation AirPods would look more like the AirPods Pro. </p><p>Sure enough, when Apple finally announced the 2021 AirPods, they debuted with a brand new look. The stems that come out of each earbud are shorter, and the earbuds themselves have a slightly new shape. The AirPods lack any sort of replaceable ear tip, with Apple keeping the one-size-fits-all approach it’s taken with standard AirPods since their launch. </p><p>On each earbud is a new sensor that detects when it’s in contact with your skin, enabling features like auto-connect and auto-pause or play when you put them in or take them out of your ears. </p><p>The stems each have a force sensor embedded. Squeezing either one will do things like pause or play music, answer a call, or trigger Siri, Apple’s personal voice assistant. </p><p>The charging case also looks more like the AirPods Pro case – only smaller. There’s a single indicator light on the front of the case to let you know when it’s charging or in pairing mode. On the back of the case is a button that you’ll use to reset the AirPods or pair them to a non-Apple device. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424529">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424529.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424529">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424529.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424529%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424529/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-wireless-earbuds/" >The best wireless earbuds With good earbuds, you can do everything from making calls when you’re on the move to listening to your favorite music to blocking out the world around you.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Charging the case, and thus the AirPods, can now be done three different ways. You can use the built-in Lightning port on the bottom of the case, a Qi wireless charging pad, or Apple’s MagSafe charging tech. It’s the same magnetic charging tech that’s used in the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13, where Apple uses magnets to line up the pad with the device and hold it in place while it wirelessly charges. </p><p>Another notable addition to the new AirPods is that both the case and the earbuds themselves are IPX4 rated for water and sweat resistance. That doesn’t mean they’re waterproof, but you shouldn’t worry if they get a little damp during a workout. </p><p>The biggest question most people have about the AirPods is whether or not they’ll fit in their ears. The second question is whether or not they’ll stay in their ears.</p><p>For me, the AirPods fit and stayed in without any issues. I’m not a runner, but walking around the block at a decent pace didn’t cause any issues with their fit. Admittedly, everyone’s ears are different, and this may not be the case for you. </p><p>My advice is to give these a try, even if the original AirPods gave you issues. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135371/19272" target="_top" id="2135371">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135371" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135371/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="More-than-improved-sound-quality-and-battery-life"><a href="#More-than-improved-sound-quality-and-battery-life" class="headerlink" title="More than improved sound quality and battery life"></a>More than improved sound quality and battery life</h2><p>AirPods on a MagSafe charging stand. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>Whenever any company, let alone Apple, releases a new product, the core features almost certainly are improved. For example, the new AirPods promise and deliver on sound quality and longer battery life. For me, there’s a more rounded sound to the 3rd generation AirPods compared to the 2nd generation AirPods; the newest ones appear to have the sound quality of the AirPods Pro. And battery life has gone up, with the new AirPods giving you six hours of listening time, up from five hours on the previous model. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-wireless-charger/"><strong>The best wireless chargers</strong></a></p><p>If you include the charging case in battery life estimates, the 3rd generation AirPods should net you about 30 hours of listening time, up from 24 hours. </p><p>There’s a catch to those battery life claims, though. That 30-hour max is if you use the AirPods with Spatial Audio turned off. Spatial Audio is new to the entry-level AirPods, and it’s a welcomed addition. Previously, Spatial Audio was something only the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max offered. </p><p>When turned on while you’re either watching a compatible video or streaming compatible audio through the Apple Music app, Spatial Audio creates a 3D audio experience that follows your head as you move it. For example, while listening to Post Malone’s song “Circles,” you can turn your head to the right or left, and the audio in your ears changes as you move. It leaves you with the impression that you’re listening to live music directly in front of you. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>Outside of the impact on battery life, the only downside to Spatial Audio is that not all music or videos in the various streaming apps are compatible. So one minute you can be listening to a track that fully supports Spatial Audio, only for the next track to lack support. It’s an odd experience going back and forth, but it’s not a dealbreaker by any means. </p><p>The new AirPods use the same H1 chip that Apple has used in previous AirPods, which enables features like quick pairing, easy device switching, extended range, and longer battery life. It also makes it possible to use the hands-free “Hey Siri” feature to send messages, get weather updates, and interact with the personal assistant just like you would on your iPhone or iPad. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/"><strong>Shopping for an iPhone? Here’s the right model for you</strong></a></p><p>One missing feature that might be a deal-breaker for some is the lack of active-noise cancellation (ANC). That means the 3rd generation AirPods also lack a transparency mode to let in some environmental sounds. For those who don’t consistently need or use ANC, it’s likely to be a non-issue. But during the last few weeks, I’ve found myself wishing they had ANC. Whether it’s blocking the background noise of my kids arguing over who gets the last piece of candy, or the <em>clickety-clack</em> of my mechanical keyboard that randomly gets on my nerves, ANC has become a feature I don’t want to go without. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044583/7443" target="_top" id="2044583">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044583" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044583/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bottom-line"><a href="#Bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom line"></a>Bottom line</h2><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>The 3rd generation $179 AirPods are going to be a hit. Just like the original AirPods, they offer functionality that can’t be matched by the competition, although, many products now come close. </p><p>There’s a lot to like about the latest AirPods. MagSafe isn’t a groundbreaking addition, but it’s something I think most iPhone owners will find themselves using as they add MagSafe chargers to their home or office. The new design looks a lot like AirPods Pro, save for the lack of adaptability. That said, I haven’t had issues with fit or comfort. </p><p>Personally, I’ve missed active-noise cancelation that the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max offer. But most of my use is in a noisy environment where I’ve grown accustomed to background noise being non-existent. </p><p>If you’ve been holding out on upgrading your AirPods for something better, the 3rd generation model is certainly it. If you’re new to AirPods, I can’t think of a better way to start your wireless earbuds experience within Apple’s ecosystem.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-explorers-blueprint-how-to-unearth-hidden-discord-communities/"><u>[New] The Explorer's Blueprint How to Unearth Hidden Discord Communities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-use-d3dgear-screen-recorder-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Use D3DGear Screen Recorder for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-uncomplicatedscreensave-free-recording-software/"><u>2024 Approved UncomplicatedScreenSave Free Recording Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/angled-monitor-repair-for-sideways-viewing/"><u>Angled Monitor Repair for Sideways Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/code-crafting-conundrum-github-copilot-versus-gpt-3/"><u>Code Crafting Conundrum: GitHub Copilot Versus GPT-3?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/creating-audio-effects-with-chatgpt-a-guide-to-innovative-sound-design-in-your-digital-audio-workstation-daw/"><u>Creating Audio Effects with ChatGPT: A Guide to Innovative Sound Design in Your Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/easy-steps-for-enabling-microsoft-copilot-on-your-mac-computer/"><u>Easy Steps for Enabling Microsoft Copilot on Your Mac Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/easy-tutorial-transforming-wmv-videos-into-playable-mp4s-on-kindle-fire-devices/"><u>Easy Tutorial: Transforming WMV Videos Into Playable MP4s on Kindle Fire Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/effective-techniques-mastering-the-art-of-writing-superior-chatgpt-queries/"><u>Effective Techniques: Mastering the Art of Writing Superior ChatGPT Queries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/emulating-expertise-training-chatgpt-for-personal-writing-style-replication/"><u>Emulating Expertise: Training ChatGPT for Personal Writing Style Replication</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/exploring-potential-security-risks-in-using-chatgpt-services/"><u>Exploring Potential Security Risks in Using ChatGPT Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/getting-started-with-chatgpt-on-smartphones-tips-for-android-and-ios/"><u>Getting Started with ChatGPT on Smartphones: Tips for Android and iOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/harnessing-chatgpt-for-detailed-poetry-books-crafting/"><u>Harnessing ChatGPT for Detailed Poetry Books Crafting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/improving-chatgpt-dialogues-a-guide-to-7-effective-techniques/"><u>Improving ChatGPT Dialogues: A Guide to 7 Effective Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/in-2024-9-no-cost-online-tools-to-make-your-own-movies/"><u>In 2024, 9 No-Cost Online Tools to Make Your Own Movies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-potential-with-these-leading-cost-free-editions/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Your Potential with These Leading Cost-Free Editions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-does-jailbreaking-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-i-do-get-answers-here-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, What Does Jailbreaking Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max i Do?

Clear messaging on what the Vision Pro can do for businesses and consumers"></a>1. Clear messaging on what the Vision Pro can do for businesses and consumers</h2><p>So, is the Vision Pro an AR or a VR device? Dr. Illenberger notes, “Apple was selling the device as an AR device, while, in fact, technologically speaking, it’s a VR device. That tells you a lot about Apple’s vision about the technology’s current capabilities.”</p><p>This disparity between Apple’s marketing and the device’s actual capabilities is problematic. Businesses investing in Vision Pro may anticipate a fully developed AR experience but could find that the device’s VR-centric capabilities do not align with their needs. This could impact adoption rates, especially among enterprises seeking AR solutions for applications such as real-time remote assistance, AR-enhanced training, or interactive AR presentations.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Dr. Illenberger emphasizes this concern: “As of today, we do not have killer use cases for B2C. The problem for Apple, or everyone in the VR industry, is you cannot dictate the killer application. The device itself is not compelling for B2C users, but as a signal, it was extremely important to everyone in the industry.”</p><p>To drive adoption, businesses must see clear, compelling AR applications that justify their investment. Apple must align the Vision Pro’s capabilities with these expectations and invest in marketing and education to showcase its potential. This includes case studies, demonstrations, and pilot programs that highlight successful implementations of the device in real-world scenarios.</p><p>Dr. Illenberger suggests, “Educating potential users about the practical benefits and showcasing successful case studies will be key to driving adoption in the business sector.”</p><p>Apple must effectively present the value of Vision Pro by showcasing real-world applications and demonstrating how the product has made a tangible impact in a business environment.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123734/7443" target="_top" id="2123734">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123734" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123734/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Development-of-compelling-vertical-industry-apps"><a href="#2-Development-of-compelling-vertical-industry-apps" class="headerlink" title="2. Development of compelling vertical industry apps"></a>2. Development of compelling vertical industry apps</h2><p>Apple’s introduction of new business APIs for Vision Pro in <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-visionos-2-features-unveiled-at-wwdc-2024-what-im-excited-about-and-puzzled-by/" >visionOS 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, particularly those targeting machine learning (ML) applications, is a significant step forward. These APIs enable on-device processing from the headset’s sensors, facilitating advanced multimodal interactions.</p><p>Imagine an aircraft mechanic using a Vision Pro to inspect an engine and receiving real-time feedback on potential issues, such as damaged jet engine blades that need replacement. Dr. Illenberger states, “The ability to process information from sensors in real-time and provide actionable feedback is crucial for applications in fields like engineering and medicine, where accuracy and immediacy are paramount.”</p><p>The Vision Pro requires industry-specific applications to target the business sector effectively, and developers should use the new ML APIs to create solutions that tackle real-world problems. For example, the Vision Pro could transform diagnostics in the medical field, enabling doctors to interpret complex medical data better. The capability to convert 2D photos into spatial photos in visionOS 2 can be especially valuable for creating detailed visualizations and presentations.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-vision-pro-review/" >Apple Vision Pro review: Fascinating, flawed, and needs to fix 5 things <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>“The success of Vision Pro in business environments will depend on the development of industry-specific applications,” Dr. Illenberger emphasizes. “Applications that solve real-world problems and offer tangible benefits will encourage adoption.”</p><h2 id="3-Improved-device-management-and-enterprise-integration"><a href="#3-Improved-device-management-and-enterprise-integration" class="headerlink" title="3. Improved device management and enterprise integration"></a>3. Improved device management and enterprise integration</h2><p>For large-scale enterprise adoption, the Vision Pro must support robust device management capabilities. This includes features like Mobile Device Management (MDM), allowing IT departments to centrally deploy, manage, and secure multiple devices. Without these capabilities, businesses will struggle to integrate Vision Pro into their infrastructure. Apple’s ecosystem must evolve to include these management features.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-businesses-proving-the-apple-vision-pro-is-breathing-new-life-into-the-enterprise/" >5 businesses proving the Apple Vision Pro is breathing new life into the enterprise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Dr. Illenberger emphasizes, “Enterprises need tools to manage and secure devices at scale. Without robust device management, integration into business environments will be challenging.”</p><p>The enterprise world thrives on efficiency and control, and without these, the Vision Pro is just another shiny gadget. Imagine a hospital setting where multiple doctors need to use the same device seamlessly – robust device management is non-negotiable.</p><h2 id="4-Competitive-pricing-for-enterprise-deployments"><a href="#4-Competitive-pricing-for-enterprise-deployments" class="headerlink" title="4. Competitive pricing for enterprise deployments"></a>4. Competitive pricing for enterprise deployments</h2><p>While the Vision Pro’s $3,500 price tag is hefty, it’s not unprecedented in enterprise VR headsets, where prices can exceed $10,000 for specialized applications. For the Vision Pro to be considered viable, Apple must offer competitive pricing models for bulk purchases and enterprise deployments. Volume discounts or enterprise leasing options could make it more accessible.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vr-headset/" >The best VR headsets right now (and how Apple Vision Pro stacks up) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>“The price is not the primary barrier in the enterprise sector,” Dr. Illenberger points out. “It’s about demonstrating value and offering pricing models that make large-scale deployments feasible.”</p><p>Apple, take note: Show the value, and enterprises will follow. If a company can see a clear ROI, the upfront cost becomes less of a hurdle. Think about industries like automotive or aerospace, where the cost of a single mistake far outweighs the price of a VR headset.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484940/16446" target="_top" id="1484940">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484940" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484940/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Access-to-full-sensor-capabilities"><a href="#5-Access-to-full-sensor-capabilities" class="headerlink" title="5. Access to full sensor capabilities"></a>5. Access to full sensor capabilities</h2><p>To fully exploit the Vision Pro’s potential, developers need unrestricted access to its sensor data. Some restricted capabilities limit the device’s use in high-stakes environments such as pilot training or surgical simulations. By providing full access to sensor data, Apple can enable developers to create highly specialized applications that meet the demands of various professional fields.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-is-reportedly-working-on-ar-glasses-and-a-cheaper-vision-headset/" >Apple is reportedly working on AR glasses and a cheaper Vision headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>“For high-stakes applications, developers need full access to the device’s capabilities,” says Dr. Illenberger. “Restrictions on sensor data limit the potential uses of Vision Pro in critical environments.”</p><p>In other words, let the device breathe and watch it soar in diverse applications.

We need faster and more reliable networks to deploy advanced AR and VR applications, including faster wireless technologies, high-speed broadband, and cloud and edge infrastructure in Apple data centers and regional partner facilities.</p><p>Dr. Illenberger remarks, “The deployment of robust network infrastructure is crucial for the future of AR and VR technologies. Without it, the full potential of devices like Vision Pro cannot be realized.”</p><h2 id="7-User-friendly-developer-tools-support-and-an-open-ecosystem"><a href="#7-User-friendly-developer-tools-support-and-an-open-ecosystem" class="headerlink" title="7. User-friendly developer tools, support, and an open ecosystem"></a>7. User-friendly developer tools, support, and an open ecosystem</h2><p>For Vision Pro to succeed in business, Apple must provide user-friendly developer tools and comprehensive support. This includes detailed documentation, sample code, and a responsive developer community. By making it easier for developers to create and deploy applications, Apple can accelerate the adoption of Vision Pro in various industries. </p><p>“Developers need the right tools and support to create applications that will drive adoption in business,” says Dr. Illenberger. “User-friendly tools and strong community support are essential.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/unveiling-agog-the-future-of-immersive-media-for-social-good/" >Agog co-founders make a big bet on the social benefits of AR, VR, and XR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The easier Apple makes supporting the Vision Pro for developers, the faster we’ll see a proliferation of applications that make it indispensable in the business world. Unfortunately, Apple’s traditional closed ecosystem may not align well with what businesses and vertical market software developers need. If Apple is too restrictive on what can be allowed in its app store for visionOS, it could stifle innovation. Every device capability needs to be transparent and accessible to the developer, not just functions that Apple cherry-picks.</p><p>“You need to have access to the device’s full capabilities,” says Dr. Illenberger. “If Apple remains too restrictive, it will limit the device’s potential and deter developers.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111968/7443" target="_top" id="2111968">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111968" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111968/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Vision-Pro-Ready-to-do-business"><a href="#Vision-Pro-Ready-to-do-business" class="headerlink" title="Vision Pro: Ready to do business?"></a>Vision Pro: Ready to do business?</h2><p>With the enhancements brought by visionOS 2 and the critical upgrades outlined above, the Apple Vision Pro could become an indispensable tool for enterprises across industries.

Yep, join the club. But you may want to try it again. Apple has finally transformed the much-maligned app into a more usable and friendly program. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PKTQ5699M62?hl=en-US&gl=US" >Available in the Microsoft Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the new iCloud for Windows comes with a complete redesign, new features, and bug fixes.</p><p>Beyond the redesign, the latest version offers an easier setup process with prompts to guide you each step of the way. It now supports physical security keys for a more secure sign-in. And thankfully, you won’t get as many of those sign-in prompts as you did in the past.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/goodbye-itunes-apple-officially-releases-replacement-media-apps-for-windows/" >Goodbye, iTunes: Apple officially releases replacement media apps for Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>You’re now able to see the syncing status of your iCloud content. In addition, Apple promises improvements to photo syncing and fixes for contact and calendar syncing with Outlook. The Outlook syncing, however, supposedly requires <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose/" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> version 22H2 or later.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The latest features and improvements are designed to fix an app that for years has been clunky, confusing, and buggy. Past versions of the app have received a slew of one-star ratings in the Microsoft Store. And that’s because you’re using a Windows PC and not a Mac.</p><p>Mac owners can easily sync their online iCloud content using a convenient and simple built-in MacOS feature. But Windows users have faced challenges in this process. With no iCloud syncing tool built into Windows, your only option has been the iCloud for Windows app. And this always felt like an app that Apple threw together haphazardly just to placate Windows users.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cloud-storage/" >The best cloud storage services <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For those of you who haven’t yet tried iCloud for Windows, the app lets you sync specific items stored in iCloud online to your Windows PC. In that vein, it offers several key features.</p><p>You can access and view your synced iCloud photos in the Microsoft Photos app for <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-11-faq-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can keep your photos up to date across your PC, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/" >iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Plus, you’re able to create shared albums that other people can view.</p><p>If you enable iCloud Drive, you can see and access your online folders and files directly in File Explorer. You’re also able to share files and automatically sync any changes to your files.</p><p>The app lets you sign in to websites using credentials you’ve stored in iCloud Keychain. You can access all your passwords and create new ones in the iCloud Passwords app, which is automatically added when you install iCloud for Windows. The iCloud Passwords extension also works in the desktop versions of Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. You can even generate verification codes to sign in to websites.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-access-and-sync-icloud-notes-on-linux/" >How to access and sync iCloud notes on Linux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>And there’s more. You’re able to view your iCloud calendars and contacts directly in Microsoft Outlook. And you can sync your bookmarks from Safari with the iCloud bookmarks extension in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.</p><p>If you already have a previous version of iCloud for Windows, the new version will automatically be installed the next time you open the app. If you don’t yet have it, head to its <a class="link"   href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PKTQ5699M62?hl=en-US&gl=US" >Microsoft Store page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download and install it.</p><p>After launching the app and signing in the first time, the setup screens will ask you which content you wish to sync. You can opt to sync your iCloud photos to the Microsoft Photos app, sync iCloud Drive to File Explorer, sync your passwords in iCloud Keychain, sync your Safari bookmarks, and sync your iCloud calendars and contacts with Outlook.</p><p>After the setup is complete, you’re placed at the newly-redesigned iCloud for Windows screen. Here, you can clearly see the syncing status of each type of content and choose which ones to turn on or off. The screen also shows you how much total space you’ve used in iCloud and how much is free.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/" >The best laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Is the new iCloud for Windows a dramatic improvement over its predecessor? A few people chiming in at the Microsoft Store have complained of syncing problems and other glitches. But an equal number have given the overhaul five-star ratings. Some reports say the app overall works better in Windows 11 than in <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-your-windows-10-pc-be-saved-in-2025-yes-for-free-heres-how/" >Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, especially the photo, contacts, and calendar syncing.</p><p>In my testing, the app ran smoothly in Windows 11 with no hiccups. It did crash once in Windows 10 when I was trying to sync my iCloud photos, but otherwise, it’s been behaving. At the very least, it already seems like a decided improvement over the old version.</p><h4 id="Apple"><a href="#Apple" class="headerlink" title="Apple"></a>Apple</h4><p><a class="link"

In fact, its ample range of sports and activity tracking features pretty much guarantee it’s going to be put in situations where a dropped barbell, incoming fastball, or even just a simple tumble could spell disaster for its display. Peripheral makers realized this before the first Apple Watch models ever reached consumers, and immediately began churning out solutions to protect against these very expensive accidents. </p><p>Ranging from simple films to complete, watertight cases, these products can completely deflect a blow that might have cracked or chipped a screen or, at worst, take the hit for their companion Apple Watch and be replaced far more cheaply than it could. </p><p>This list provides a cross-section of some of the best options currently available. Whether you’re shopping for a stealthy, but protective screen film, or a ruggedized, no-holds-barred full enclosure, we’ve selected the best options for keeping your pricey smartwatch nice and safe, no matter what traumas you may subject it to. </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K37CV3C?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca7a981a7-0cf3-466c-9f4d-e2f9d943080e%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Catalyst-Protective-Waterproof-Case"><a href="#Catalyst-Protective-Waterproof-Case" class="headerlink" title="Catalyst Protective Waterproof Case"></a>Catalyst Protective Waterproof Case</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915805/19272" target="_top" id="1915805">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915805" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915805/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-screen-protector"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-screen-protector" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch screen protector"></a>Best Apple Watch screen protector</h3><p>It may seem a bit odd that one of the most ruggedized Apple Watch screen protectors on this list doesn’t actually cover the device’s display. Instead, it surrounds it with one of the beefiest enclosures we were able to find, including raised bezels that greatly reduce the chance of anything impacting the display. </p><p>The Catalyst Waterproof Case is also one of the few options that even enclose the smartwatch’s Digital Crown, providing a water-tight seal that Catalyst claims can essentially double the unit’s 164-foot of water resistance to 330 feet. </p><p>This is, however, an option that is really only for those that expect to be wearing their Apple Watch in the most extreme conditions. As such, it does come with some sacrifices, including a lack of ECG support due to encasing the necessary buttons, and a permanent band that does not officially support being replaced. </p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Raised bezels to protect display</li><li>Full enclosure, including Digital Crown</li><li>Waterproof to 330 feet</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Pricey</li><li>Blocks ECG Sensor</li></ul><p>Supported Models: Apple Watch Series 3,4,5,6, and SE</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HSS4KYJ?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca7a981a7-0cf3-466c-9f4d-e2f9d943080e%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Spigen-Rugged-Armor-Protector"><a href="#Spigen-Rugged-Armor-Protector" class="headerlink" title="Spigen Rugged Armor Protector"></a>Spigen Rugged Armor Protector</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-affordable-full-enclosure"><a href="#Best-affordable-full-enclosure" class="headerlink" title="Best affordable full enclosure"></a>Best affordable full enclosure</h3><p>Spigen is a brand that should be well known to most people that have shopped for a smartphone case in the past decade. Their affordable and varied enclosures tend to sit at the top of Amazon review metrics and consistently provide solid, affordable protection for the devices installed in them.</p><p>This entry into the company’s offerings attempts to find a balance between a ruggedized, full enclosure and unrestricted access to all functions of the Apple Watch. This includes leaving the Digital Crown bare to maintain ECG functionality for models that support it, and using a thin backplate that doesn’t interfere with the official Apple Watch charger. </p><p>Although most are unlikely to peg this option as being fashion-forward, Spigen has attempted to cushion the potential blow to any wearer’s aesthetic by making it available in Black, Navy Blue, Olive Green, Rose Gold, and White. Certainly, it’s not the stealthiest accessory, but it provides an excellent level of protection to the wearer’s wrist-worn investment without as many compromises as the Catalyst option seen above.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Maintains ECG functionality</li><li>Available in five colors</li><li>Raised bezels for screen protection</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Rugged looks may not play well for formal settings</li><li>No direct protection from scratching for display</li></ul><p>Supported Models: Apple Watch Series 4,5,6,7, and SE</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089ZRVKC4?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca7a981a7-0cf3-466c-9f4d-e2f9d943080e%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135394/19272" target="_top" id="2135394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135394/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Smiling-Case-Overall-Protective-Hard-PC-Case-Ultra-Thin-Cover"><a href="#Smiling-Case-Overall-Protective-Hard-PC-Case-Ultra-Thin-Cover" class="headerlink" title="Smiling Case Overall Protective Hard PC Case Ultra-Thin Cover"></a>Smiling Case Overall Protective Hard PC Case Ultra-Thin Cover</h2><h3 id="Best-almost-invisible-option"><a href="#Best-almost-invisible-option" class="headerlink" title="Best almost invisible option"></a>Best almost invisible option</h3><p>The Smiling Case is, as the name might suggest, one of the slew of OEM options in this product category that can be found on Amazon. However, its reviews and its rare combination of a built-in, tempered glass screen cover with a full enclosure design make it a standout among those hundreds of other options. </p><p>While a full enclosure can never be truly invisible, this protector is about as close as you can get. Using clear plastic and tempered glass, a bystander might actually miss it at a casual glance. Despite its stealth, the product still provides protection for the metal sides and display, while promising accurate and responsive pass-through of all touch commands. </p><p>The only downside for some users might be the cover’s interference with the Digital Crown and Side Button. Although it lives up to its “Ultra-Thin” monicker, it still reduces the protrusion of the crown, making it slightly harder to turn, while also adding a recess users will need to reach into to depress the Side Button. If this seems like too much inconvenience, then a full enclosure likely just isn’t the best option for you.</p><p>Pros: </p><ul><li>Includes tempered glass screen cover</li><li>Clear shell provides no aesthetic changes</li><li>Maintains ECG functionality</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>May make use of Digital Crown and Side Button slightly more difficult</li><li>Not from a well-known brand</li></ul><p>Supported Models: Apple Watch Series 4,5,6,7, and SE</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RLZP5XX?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca7a981a7-0cf3-466c-9f4d-e2f9d943080e%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="LK-Screen-Protector"><a href="#LK-Screen-Protector" class="headerlink" title="LK Screen Protector"></a>LK Screen Protector</h2><h3 id="Best-screen-only-film"><a href="#Best-screen-only-film" class="headerlink" title="Best screen-only film"></a>Best screen-only film</h3><p>For wearers that want to protect their unit’s display, but just can’t stand the idea of covering any of the Apple Watch’s visual appeal, the LK Screen Protector is an excellent option. Made of “Self-Healing” TPU, the skin is designed to provide 99% transparency and complete retention of screen sensitivity and responsiveness.</p><p>In addition to being able to automatically remove bubbles under the film following installation, LK also promises that the film will heal any scratches the user may subject it to within 24 hours of their appearance. Even if this weren’t the case, the low cost for a large multi-pack means that replacing the screen protector barely costs more than one dollar. </p><p>Of course, films like this and the SuperShields option below will protect from scratches, and may help to ward off minor impacts. But, they will do little to prevent damage from severe blows. For owners expecting that type of abuse, we suggest one of the sturdier, albeit far more noticeable options towards the top of this list.</p><p>Pros: </p><ul><li>TPU material rejects bubbles and “heals” scratches within 24 hours</li><li>Easy application with included kit</li><li>Inexpensive multi-pack options</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>No protection for edges and little protection from severe impacts</li><li>Edge of protector may be noticeable to sensitive fingers while using touchscreen.</li></ul><p>Supported models: Apple Watch Series 6,7, and SE.</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J2C53CC?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca7a981a7-0cf3-466c-9f4d-e2f9d943080e%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972670/19272" target="_top" id="1972670">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972670" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972670/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="IQ-Shield-Matte-Screen-Protector"><a href="#IQ-Shield-Matte-Screen-Protector" class="headerlink" title="IQ Shield Matte Screen Protector"></a>IQ Shield Matte Screen Protector</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139116/17108" target="_top" id="2139116">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139116" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139116/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-anti-glare-film"><a href="#Best-anti-glare-film" class="headerlink" title="Best anti-glare film"></a>Best anti-glare film</h3><p>The IQ Shield option shown here addresses an issue that no other entry on this list does: glare. Anyone that’s struggled to see what their Apple Watch was trying to tell them while outdoors or directly under a harsh overhead light should appreciate the possibility of having those bothersome reflections reduced or eliminated by the matte finish on the IQ Shield Screen Protector. </p><p>IQ Shield is also somewhat unique in designing its flexible film to fit right up against the curved edges of the Apple Watch display, something many manufacturers skip in favor of a smaller, rectangular film with visible edges. This “precise fitment” not only improves the appearance of the protector, but also helps eliminate the annoying sensation of running over the edge of a screen protector when using the Apple Watch touchscreen.</p><p>Like most matte-finish films, the IQ Shield version does have some minimal impact on things like screen brightness and color accuracy. However, the benefit of not having to fight bright outside lights, especially when trying to view the somewhat dimmer displays on older Apple Watch models, will likely be more than enough to make up for any modest impact on image quality.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Matte finish blocks glare</li><li>Designed specifically to wrap around screen edges</li><li>Inexpensive multi-pack options</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Could slightly impact screen clarity or color accuracy</li><li>Won’t protect from severe impacts</li></ul><p>Supported Models: Apples Watch Series 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, and SE.</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-screen-protectors"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-screen-protectors" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these screen protectors?"></a>How did we choose these screen protectors?</h2><p>The range of abuses an Apple Watch could see in its life is as varied and diverse as the user base it serves. Because of these, we’ve chosen a range of products for an assorted clientele. We feel each of these offerings is the best of the best in their particular slot of this product category. That said, it would be silly to compare a ruggedized, complete enclosure to a simple screen film. Obviously the former offers the most protection, but the latter may be preferable for users unwilling to accept any aesthetic sacrifices in the name of safety and protection for their Apple Watch. This is why each of these options includes a note or two about their ideal user, and where that user’s priorities may lie on the spectrums of form over function and protection versus visibility. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141683/17092" target="_top" id="2141683">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2141683" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettide.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141683/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-screen-protector"><a href="#What-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-screen-protector" class="headerlink" title="What is the best Apple Watch screen protector?"></a>What is the best Apple Watch screen protector?</h2><p>The best Apple Watch screen protector is the Catalyst Protective Waterproof Case, because it is waterproof, extremely durable, and well designed.</p><h2 id="Do-I-really-need-a-screen-protector"><a href="#Do-I-really-need-a-screen-protector" class="headerlink" title="Do I really need a screen protector?"></a>Do I really need a screen protector?</h2><p> This is, of course, a personal decision. For some, even the most inexpensive Apple Watch can be a major investment, well worth protecting. For others, the idea of damaging their watch’s hardy Ion-X glass may be unlikely enough, or inconsequential enough that they would prefer to just take the risk and pay for repairs, if needed. Ultimately, it’s a matter of budgeting for the cost of potential future repairs versus the definite cost and possible aesthetic blow resulting from adding some form of screen protector.</p><h2 id="What-if-I-have-AppleCare-for-my-Apple-Watch"><a href="#What-if-I-have-AppleCare-for-my-Apple-Watch" class="headerlink" title="What if I have AppleCare+ for my Apple Watch?"></a>What if I have AppleCare+ for my Apple Watch?</h2><p>Apple’s well-known AppleCare+ program has saved many a device from an early grave. However, it’s important to understand the AppleCare+ policy on “accidental damage,” which any cracking or chipping of the display would fall under. According to Apple, each Watch owner qualifies for up to 2 accidental repairs per year. While this seems generous enough for all but the clumsiest owners, it also comes with a $69 fee for each of these repairs. That’s in addition to the initial $79 cost of the extended warranty. Any repeat offender maxing out their yearly repair allowance is going to very quickly rack up quite a bill for screen replacements, and may want to consider just adding a screen protector instead.</p><h2 id="Will-a-screen-protector-void-my-warranty"><a href="#Will-a-screen-protector-void-my-warranty" class="headerlink" title="Will a screen protector void my warranty?"></a>Will a screen protector void my warranty?</h2><p>The short answer: no. Most screen protectors of any decent quality can easily be removed without leaving any sign that they were ever present. Since it’s always a good idea to remove any aftermarket accessories from any electronic device before bringing it in for service, Apple will likely never know the screen protector existed, and wouldn’t much care, even if it did. </p><h2 id="Which-screen-protector-is-right-for-you"><a href="#Which-screen-protector-is-right-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Which screen protector is right for you?"></a>Which screen protector is right for you?</h2><p>The selections here were chosen to represent the full spectrum of options available. The most important thing in determining where your priorities fall within this range of products is deciding whether aesthetics are more important than protection, or vice-versa. The fashion-conscious among us probably wouldn’t be caught dead in some of the ruggedized options near the top of the list, while the extreme athletes out there might chuckle at the relatively meager protection offered by a simple screen film. You have to decide how much of an aesthetic sacrifice you’re willing to make in the name of protecting your Apple Watch.</p><h4 id="ZDNET-Recommends-1"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends-1" class="headerlink"

But note that upscaling a low-quality video to a high-quality video with perfect clarity in VLC is impossible. The improvement will be limited by the video’s original quality. </p><h3 id="1-Adjust-Effect-Setting-for-Better-Display-Effects"><a href="#1-Adjust-Effect-Setting-for-Better-Display-Effects" class="headerlink" title="1.

Because Apple just launched a new webpage <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/why-upgrade/?from=iphone-12&to=iphone-15" >headlined <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>: “Your iPhone vs. the latest.” The idea is to tease owners of older iPhones to trade in and trade up.</p><p>I should mention that I’m perfectly happy with my iPhone 12.

I should also mention that I don’t upgrade my iPhone every year.</p><p>Previous to this iPhone 12 I had an iPhone XR. Previous to that, an iPhone 6. (Shame on me.)</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>So what could Apple tell me now that would make me instantly conclude I need an iPhone 15? It seems there are quite a few reasons to upgrade. Will any one of them be enough? Will all of them together be enough?</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="It’s-the-camera-stupid"><a href="#It’s-the-camera-stupid" class="headerlink" title="It’s the camera, stupid"></a>It’s the camera, stupid</h2><p>The company’s first gambit is: “iPhone 15 captures up to 4x the resolution of iPhone 12for a new level of detail and color.”</p><p>I believe this, but the question is: How much does this matter? Have I been concerned about my resolution? Have I been deeply disappointed with my iPhone 12’s camera? I haven’t, but perhaps I should have been.</p><p>So what’s next? Well, it’s: “Save way more shots with 2x more storage than iPhone 12.” That could be something, but do I take so many shots that I should be worried? I’m not sure that I do. I suspect I’m below average on the shot-o-meter. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-incredible-evolution-of-smartphone-cameras-and-how-ai-powers-a-dazzling-future/" >The incredible evolution of smartphone cameras and how AI powers a dazzling future <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Moreover, there’s a tiny number 2 next to this claim. I search at the bottom of the page for an explanation: “Storage comparison based on starting capacity.” Which sounds like something of complex qualifier.</p><p>Next Apple offers: “Get more room to zoom with a 2x Telephoto. It’s like having a third camera.” So we’re still on the camera and picture-taking? I suppose that’s really the main contemporary use for a smartphone. It’s a camera with a phone attached.</p><p>On which subject, we move to Apple’s next tease: “If your subject is a person, dog, or cat, iPhone 15 lets you quickly capture the shot and turn it into a portrait later.” This makes it sound like it’s a feature only for people, dogs, and cats. Which, again, is nice but is it worth the upgrade?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129741/7443" target="_top" id="2129741">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129741" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129741/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="And-it’s-the-movies"><a href="#And-it’s-the-movies" class="headerlink" title="And it’s the movies"></a>And it’s the movies</h2><p>The list has only just begun. There’s: “When you’re shooting video on the go, use Action mode to steady really shaky handheld shots.” Good, but not persuasive in itself – and how often do people shoot on the go? </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/need-a-smartphone-that-keeps-going-and-going-this-one-can-last-over-3-months-on-standby/" >Need a smartphone that keeps going and going? This one can last over 3 months <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How about: “Make movies like the movies with Cinematic mode, which automatically shifts the focus to the most important subject in a scene.” I like this. Somewhat. But we all know that when Apple features movies shot on an iPhone, there are a lot of expensive lights and film crew involved.</p><p>Apple follows this with the enticing: “USB-C means you can charge your Mac, iPad, or PC with the same cable as iPhone 15.” Ah, yes. My iPhone 12 still uses Lightning. But I get around that little issue by using a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-wireless-charger/" >wireless charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Next, Apple tries: “The A16 Bionic chip has a GPU that’s up to 40% faster than the GPU in A14 Bionic.” I wonder how many people know their GPUs from their CPUs. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-deals/" >The best iPhone deals of 2024: Free iPhone 15s, free iPads, cheap accessories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple explains: “Longer battery life lets you watch up to 3 more hours of video than iPhone 12.” But there’s a tiny number 3 next to it. This footnote offers: “All battery claims depend on network configuration and many other factors; actual results will vary. Battery has limited recharge cycles and may eventually need to be replaced. Battery life and charge cycles vary by use and settings.”</p><p>That’s the thing when people buy phones. They prefer actual results. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/352555/5172" target="_top" id="352555">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-352555" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/352555/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Can-I-buy-into-the-dynamism"><a href="#Can-I-buy-into-the-dynamism" class="headerlink" title="Can I buy into the dynamism?"></a>Can I buy into the dynamism?</h2><p>And now to the feature that, to many owners of older phones, might be quite moving: “iPhone 15 gives you Dynamic Island, which bubbles up your flight status, music, and more so you don’t miss anything. It expands to get your attention – hey, your ride is here! – then tucks away again.”</p><p>This is a feature Apple plugged enthusiastically as soon as it was invented. I think I want to see what it’s like to live with. I’ve played with it in an Apple store, but it hasn’t yet been enough in itself to persuade me to upgrade. Now, that is.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/" >The best iPhone models you can buy right now (including the iPhone 15) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If you’ve scrolled this far on Apple’s page of persuasion, you might get the feeling that the company is dying trying. Because the next element is: “iPhone 15 is built to last, thanks to a durable design with an aerospace-grade aluminum enclosure and a Ceramic Shield front that’s tougher than any smartphone glass.” </p><p>But my iPhone 12 – clearly – was built to last. It’s still doing very well. No screen replacements, no malfunctions. (Thank you, Apple.)</p><p>Curiously, then, Apple ends with a side-by-side comparison of my iPhone 12’s display and the iPhone 15’s.</p><p>They’re identical, which perhaps shows how <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-incredible-evolution-of-smartphone-cameras-and-how-ai-powers-a-dazzling-future/" >true invention in smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has rather slowed over time. Certainly for iPhones.</p><p>Of course, the decision to upgrade may depend on particular features. Or even an accumulation of features that, in themselves, are relatively small.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/view-and-filter-your-entire-apple-app-store-purchase-history/" >You can now view, search, and filter your entire Apple App Store purchase history <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I fancy, though, that upgrading is an emotional decision too. </p><p>You look at each new iPhone that comes out and wonder whether there’s anything about it that moves you enough to make a change. (Apple says I’ll get up to $220 in credit if I trade in my iPhone 12.) It might even be a new color – as much as a new camera feature – that finally talks you up. It might also be that your phone just doesn’t work so well anymore and you’re just in the mood for a change.</p><p>For me, I consider that it’s April. I feel sure <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-reports-spatial-video-and-ultra-thin-bezels-coming-to-all-models/" >there’s a new iPhone coming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the Fall. Because there always is. </p><p>Perhaps that one will have something about it that I just can’t resist. I can wait. I’ve learned to do that over the years.  </p><h4 id="iPhone"><a href="#iPhone" class="headerlink" title="iPhone"></a>iPhone</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/"  title="The 8 best iPhone models: Which one is right for you?">The 8 best iPhone models: Which one is right for you?
