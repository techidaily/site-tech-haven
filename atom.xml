The idea was to open up ChatGPT’s immense capabilities to third-party developers, who would then innovate and build even more powerful tools by leveraging the AI chatbot.</p><p> However, several months along the line, the launch of ChatGPT plugins hasn’t really had the impact observers believed it would. Instead, poorly built plugins that aren’t extending the chatbot’s capabilities in any meaningful way litter the store. Have an important task at hand? Skip these ChatGPT plugins that make big promises but come up short on delivery.</p><p> On March 19, 2024,<a class="link"   href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8988022-winding-down-the-chatgpt-plugins-beta" >OpenAI disabled ChatGPT Plugin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> conversations and completely removed them on April 9, 2024. ChatGPT Plugins were removed because much of their functionality can be found in<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-custom-gpt-store/" >custom GPTs and the GPT Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="1-I-Am-Rich"><a href="#1-I-Am-Rich" class="headerlink" title="1. I Am Rich"></a>1. I Am Rich</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/the-i-am-rich-plugin-on-the-chatgpt-plugin-store.jpg"                      alt="The I Am Rich plugin on the ChatGPT plugin store"                ></p><p> The “I Am Rich” plugin is one of the most confusing plugins on the ChatGPT platform. If you’re ever curious about what it does and go poking around—you’re probably already wasting your time because the plugin does absolutely nothing. And this is not an exaggeration.</p><p> To trigger the plugin, you’re supposed to activate it, and then include the text “I am rich” in your prompt. What happens when you do this? Well, ChatGPT is supposed to load an image of a crystal with a glow around it. What purpose does the image serve? Unless you value it as “artwork,” there’s really nothing else it does.</p><p> Years ago, there was an app on the Apple Store that cost around $999.99 which did the same thing. Once you installed the app, the only thing it did was show you the image. The only value it offered was showing people that you were rich enough to afford it.</p><p> The app was swiftly taken off the Apple Store after several bad reviews. Was this plugin developed by the same person? We are not sure. But it sure has the same function—absolutely nothing.</p><h2 id="2-Aaron-Web-Browser"><a href="#2-Aaron-Web-Browser" class="headerlink" title="2. Aaron Web Browser"></a>2.

One would think that the description accurately captures the plugin’s capabilities, but upon closer inspection, it’s not entirely true. We tried to scrape data from 20 different URLs and only one went through.</p><p> For a plugin that advertises itself as a web crawler, the failure rates were extremely high. In fairness, we tried other web scrapper plugins available on the ChatGPT plugin store, and they weren’t particularly better at their job either. Need to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-web-scraping/" >scrap data from a web page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ?

It’s relatively easy to use, and you can deploy fully functional mobile apps in a very short time without having to write a single line of code.</p><p> Considering such a reputation, when AppyPie’s plugin popped up in the ChatGPT plugins store, it seemed like you’d be able to build apps on demand by simply describing what you want in plain language. Just type in a prompt describing the kind of app you want and have the plugin build it immediately.</p><p> The plugin itself is self-described as a “text-to-app” plugin, which sort of fits our expectations. Unfortunately, AppyPie’s ChatGPT plugin is anything but that. Irrespective of how detailed or shallow you get with your description, it simply tells you the app is ready, presents a link to customize the app and that’s about all you get.</p><p> The link leads to the AppyPie website, but there’s actually no app waiting to be customized. You’ll end up being prompted to register and subscribe to its no-code app-building platform. It’s an annoying attempt at advertisement.</p><p> Sure, it seems a bit unreasonable to expect a working text-to-app plugin that can spit out apps on demand. But in an era where chatbots can write code and where text-to-image and text-to-video are a thing, text-to-app is not that ridiculous of an expectation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDNwgyE0nbY?si=3k_WBhpIw3WudJot" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-AI-Agents"><a href="#4-AI-Agents" class="headerlink" title="4.

The plugin self-describes as a plugin to help you “unleash the power of multiple AIs.” The idea is to take a complex goal, break it into subtasks, and then leverage the power of multiple AI agents specializing in each subtask to achieve the big goal you set for it.</p><p> It, at least in theory, is supposed to be able to do something akin to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-auto-gpt-how-differ-from-chatgpt/" >what AutoGPT does <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Unfortunately, irrespective of the complexity of the task we set for it, the plugin couldn’t deliver anything.</p><p> It seems it was just applying a few prompt tricks and returning a not-so-enhanced copy of what ChatGPT would provide. There’s really no sense of AI agents at work. It doesn’t offer anything particularly different from what ChatGPT would do.</p><h2 id="5-A-Movie-Please-FilmFindr"><a href="#5-A-Movie-Please-FilmFindr" class="headerlink" title="5.

Although the plugin is not a dud (it actually makes movie recommendations), you’re better off using ChatGPT without the plugin.</p><p> Once you’ve provided a description of the kind of movie you want, the plugin only ever recommends movies that are available on Amazon’s Prime streaming service. If you have a niche taste in movies, you’ll find the recommendations to be mediocre at best.</p><p> For quality movie suggestions, you’re better off prompting the base ChatGPT model directly<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-movie-shows-recommendations/" >to decide what to watch next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . By going that route, you’ll get far superior results compared to relying on the “A Movie Please” plugin.</p><h2 id="6-ABC-Website-Maker"><a href="#6-ABC-Website-Maker" class="headerlink" title="6. ABC Website Maker"></a>6. ABC Website Maker</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/abc-website-maker-plugin-on-the-chatgpt-plugin-store.jpg"                      alt="ABC Website maker plugin on the ChatGPT plugin store"                ></p><p> The ABC website maker promises “conversational coding” where you can build web apps at a moment’s notice by simply conversing with the plugin in natural language. In theory, these abilities should be relatively easy to pull off, considering ChatGPT on its own is already an impressive conversational coding tool.</p><p> However, when we tasked the plugin with creating a simple portfolio website, the result was underwhelming.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT’s-Plugin-Store-Quantity-Over-Quality"><a href="#ChatGPT’s-Plugin-Store-Quantity-Over-Quality" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT’s Plugin Store: Quantity Over Quality?"></a>ChatGPT’s Plugin Store: Quantity Over Quality?</h2><p> Rather than hastening progress, the “quantity over quality” trajectory that the ChatGPT plugin store seems to be towing is promoting lacklustre plugins that clutter the store. These plugins divert attention from other more promising tools that could truly push ChatGPT to new heights. Nonetheless, we hope that as the plugin store matures, higher-quality offerings will surface.</p><p> Once developers dig deeper into ChatGPT’s capabilities and innovate at its edges, we may finally see plugins that unlock the AI’s full power. But for now, relying on the base ChatGPT model or proven third-party tools is a better bet for most tasks. Our verdict? The ChatGPT plugin gold rush has yet to strike gold.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-understanding-why-youre-not-seen/"><u>2024 Approved Understanding Why You're Not Seen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/fixing-dolby-digital-issues-how-to-restart-the-dolby-audio-driver-on-windows-10/"><u>Fixing Dolby Digital Issues: How to Restart the Dolby Audio Driver on Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/how-to-uncover-hidden-facebook-vids-updated-guide/"><u>How to Uncover Hidden Facebook Vids (Updated Guide)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-beginners-roadmap-to-professional-video-sound-recording/"><u>In 2024, A Beginner's Roadmap to Professional Video Sound Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-stop-google-chrome-from-tracking-your-location-on-vivo-s18-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Stop Google Chrome from Tracking Your Location On Vivo S18 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-xiaomi-redmi-k70-phone-without-pin-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Xiaomi Redmi K70 Phone without PIN</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/top-4-free-myspace-video-converters-with-mp4-and-mp3-downloads/"><u>Top 4 Free MySpace Video Converters with MP4 & MP3 Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/top-5-dvd-ripper-applications-of-2024-to-transform-dvr-videos-into-avi-on-windows-systems/"><u>Top 5 DVD Ripper Applications of 2024 to Transform DVR Videos Into AVI on Windows Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/top-5-online-platforms-for-free-downloads-of-popular-bollywood-tracks/"><u>Top 5 Online Platforms for Free Downloads of Popular Bollywood Tracks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/top-rated-webm-video-converter-tool-effortlessly-switch-between-formats/"><u>Top Rated WebM Video Converter Tool - Effortlessly Switch Between Formats</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Now that Google Gemini has launched, we can finally put it to the test and see how Gemini compares to GPT-4.</p><p> When Google launched Bard in March 2023, there were many reasons to be excited. Finally, OpenAI’s ChatGPT monopoly would be broken, and we’d get worthy competition.</p><p> But Bard was never the AI titan people hoped for, and GPT-4 remains the dominant generative AI chat bot platform. Now, Google’s Gemini is here—but is the long-awaited AI model better than ChatGPT?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMS5pm0SQlQ?si=gasOo6p2agrVlIb7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-Google’s-Gemini-AI-Model"><a href="#What-Is-Google’s-Gemini-AI-Model" class="headerlink" title="What Is Google’s Gemini AI Model?"></a>What Is Google’s Gemini AI Model?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-googles-ai-project-gemini/" >Gemini is Google’s most capable generative AI model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , able to understand and operate across different data formats, including text, audio, image, and video. It is Google’s attempt to create a unified AI model drawing capabilities from its most capable AI technologies. Gemini will be available in three variants:</p><ol><li><strong>Gemini Ultra:</strong> The largest and most capable variant designed to handle highly complex tasks.</li><li><strong>Gemini Pro:</strong> The best model for scaling and delivering high performance across a wide range of tasks, but less capable than Ultra.</li><li><strong>Gemini Nano:</strong> The most efficient model designed for on-device task deployment. For example, developers can use Gemini Nano to build mobile apps or integrated systems, bringing powerful AI into the mobile space.</li></ol><p> On its official blog,<a class="link"   href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/" >The Keyword <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Google says Gemini Ultra outperforms the state-of-the-art in several benchmarks. Google claims Gemini Ultra beats the industry-leading GPT-4 in several key benchmarks.</p><p> With an unprecedented 90.0% score on the rigorous MMLU benchmark, Google says Gemini Ultra is the first model to surpass human-level performance on this multifaceted test spanning 57 subjects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-gemini-ai-data-comparing-to-open-ai-gpt4-model.jpg"                      alt="google gemini ai data comparing to open ai gpt4 model"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/#performance" >Google <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Gemini Ultra can also understand, explain, and generate high-quality code in some of the world’s most popular programming languages, including Go, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++. On paper, these are all great results. But these are all benchmarks, and benchmarks do not always tell the whole story. So, how well does Gemini perform in real-world tasks?</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Google-Gemini-AI"><a href="#How-to-Use-Google-Gemini-AI" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Google Gemini AI"></a>How to Use Google Gemini AI</h2><p> Of the three variants of the Gemini AI model, you can start using Gemini Pro right now.

To use Gemini Pro with Bard, head to<a class="link"   href="http://bard.google.com/chat" >bard.google.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and sign in with your Google account.</p><p> Google says that Gemini Ultra will roll out in January 2024, so we’ve had to settle for testing Gemini Pro against ChatGPT for now.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHFtYJppXFk?si=ylFaAT4nXqCmlV8F" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Gemini-Compares-to-GPT-3-5-and-GPT-4"><a href="#How-Gemini-Compares-to-GPT-3-5-and-GPT-4" class="headerlink" title="How Gemini Compares to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4"></a>How Gemini Compares to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4</h2><p> When any new AI model is launched, it is tested against OpenAI’s GPT AI models, which are generally accepted as the state-of-the-art model other models should be held up against. So, using Bard and ChatGPT, we tested Gemini’s ability in math, creative writing, code generation, and accurately processing image inputs.</p><p> Starting with the easiest math question we could think of, we asked both chatbots to solve:<strong>-1 x -1 x -1</strong> .</p><p> Bard went first. We repeated the question twice, all coming back with wrong answers. We did get the answer on the third attempt, but that doesn’t count.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bard-answers-math-question.jpg"                      alt="Bard answers Math question"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RvR5PNhspKE?si=uJcMYK9v-_Xq7fAg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>We tried ChatGPT running on GPT-3.5. The first trial got it right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/chatgpt-answers-math-question.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT answers math question"                ></p><p> To test Gemini’s image interpretation abilities, we tasked it with interpreting some popular memes. It declined, saying it can’t interpret images with people in it. ChatGPT, running GPT-4V, was willing and able to do so flawlessly.</p><p> We tried another attempt at making it interpret an image while testing its problem-solving and coding ability. We gave Bard, running Gemini Pro, a screenshot and asked it to interpret and write HTML and CSS code to replicate the screenshot.</p><p>Here’s the source screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screenshot-to-replicate.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of Chatbase chatbot creator"                ></p><p> Below is Gemini Pro’s attempt to interpret and replicate the screenshot using HTML and CSS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/results-of-screenshot-replication-by-bard.jpg"                      alt="results of screenshot replication by Bard"                ></p><p> And here’s GPT-4’s attempt at replicating the screenshot. The result is not surprising, considering GPT-4 has historically been strong at coding. We’ve previously demonstrated<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-how-build-web-app/" >using GPT-4 to build a web app from scratch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/results-of-screenshot-replication-by-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="results of screenshot replication by ChatGPT"                ></p><p> We asked Gemini Pro to create a poem about Tesla (the electric vehicle car brand). It showed marginal improvements from previous tests we’ve done in the past. Here’s the result:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bard-writes-peom.jpg"                      alt="Bard running Gemini Pro writes a poem"                ></p><p> At this point, we thought comparing the results against GPT-3.5 rather than the supercharged GPT-4 would be more appropriate. So, we asked ChatGPT running GPT-3.5 to create a similar poem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/chatgpt-writes-poem.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT writes poem"                ></p><p> It may be a personal choice, but Gemini Pro’s take on this seems better. But we’ll let you be the judge.</p><h2 id="Is-Gemini-Better-than-ChatGPT"><a href="#Is-Gemini-Better-than-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Is Gemini Better than ChatGPT?"></a>Is Gemini Better than ChatGPT?</h2><p> Before Google launched Bard, we thought it’d be the ChatGPT competition we had been waiting for—it wasn’t. Now, Gemini is here, and so far, Gemini Pro doesn’t seem like the model to give ChatGPT the knockout punch.</p><p> Google says Gemini Ultra is going to be much better. We truly hope it is, and that it meets or exceeds the claims made in the Gemini Ultra announcement. But until we see and test the best version of Google’s generative AI tool, we won’t know if it can unseat other AI model competitors. As it stands, GPT-4 remains the undisputed AI model champion.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/eamwork-in-video-production-boosting-channel-size-for-2024/"><u>[New] Teamwork in Video Production, Boosting Channel Size for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-complete-guide-to-reversed-videos-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Complete Guide to Reversed Videos on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-planting-prowess-in-valheim-uncovering-premium-saplings-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Planting Prowess in Valheim Uncovering Premium Saplings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-the-elite-list-15-high-quality-unboxing-vids-of-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Elite List 15 High-Quality Unboxing Vids of 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/556s6zat56e75yuv44gn5yaz55yf5lplusu5b6pic0g44cm5pif44gu5lplusu5b6p6jas44cn5luk44gz44gq5lqi57se/"><u>瞬間移動で写真修復 - 「星の修復薬」今すぐ予約</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/mp4-amvand/"><u>優れたMP4 AMV変換ソフトウェアの選び方&無料ダウンロードサイトレビュー</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/fix-hp-deskjet-printer-windows-10-driver-issues/"><u>Fix HP Deskjet Printer Windows 10 Driver Issues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-from-vivo-y200e-5g-devices-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass Google FRP Lock from Vivo Y200e 5G Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/mastering-video-downsizing-optimized-strategies-for-uploading-to-vimeo/"><u>Mastering Video Downsizing: Optimized Strategies for Uploading to Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/quick-and-effortless-methods-for-changing-mp4-audiovideo-to-optimized-opus-files/"><u>Quick & Effortless Methods for Changing MP4 Audio/Video to Optimized Opus Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/quick-and-effortless-downloading-top-party-hits/"><u>Quick and Effortless: Downloading Top Party Hits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/quick-guide-speedy-mov-video-compression-in-windows-11/"><u>Quick Guide: Speedy MOV Video Compression in Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/redirected-routes-at-wonderfox-where-every-404-leads-you-back-home/"><u>Redirected Routes at WonderFox: Where Every 404 Leads You Back Home</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/simple-and-effective-ways-to-change-your-country-on-youtube-app-of-your-realme-c67-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Simple and Effective Ways to Change Your Country on YouTube App Of your Realme C67 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Exploring-Snapchat’s-My-AI-More-Than-Just-Playful-Engagements-Top-Reasons-Why"><a href="#Exploring-Snapchat’s-My-AI-More-Than-Just-Playful-Engagements-Top-Reasons-Why" class="headerlink" title="Exploring Snapchat’s My AI: More Than Just Playful Engagements - Top Reasons Why"></a>Exploring Snapchat’s My AI: More Than Just Playful Engagements - Top Reasons Why</h2><p> Snapchat made headlines in February 2023 after releasing My AI, its in-platform chatbot. The company calls it an all-around assistant that answers trivia questions, suggests recipes, and plans trips, among other daily tasks.</p><p> Despite My AI’s simple interface, it’s a fairly sophisticated tool. You can do so much with it. Here are six reasons Snapchat’s My AI feature is more than just a cool toy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zAzTErKy6h8?si=vi5z3M9_7fW6qiAJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-My-AI-Runs-on-GPT-3-5"><a href="#1-My-AI-Runs-on-GPT-3-5" class="headerlink" title="1. My AI Runs on GPT-3.5"></a>1. My AI Runs on GPT-3.5</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-and-openai-logo.jpg"                      alt="Snapchat Logo on top of Blurred OpenAI Logos"                ></p><p> Snapchat uses the same<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/" >large language model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (LLM) as ChatGPT. The GPT model is a powerful LLM that composes coherent paragraphs, adopts different writing styles, and uses everyday language. Its output almost seems indistinguishable from human writing.</p><p> Snapchat’s trainers also use the same datasets. You’ll notice that My AI knows the same things as ChatGPT does, especially with general knowledge questions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-my-ai-recognizing-image-of-object.jpg"                      alt="Snapchat My AI Explaining the Details of an Image of an Object"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-recognizing-image-of-person.jpg"                      alt="Snapchat My AI Explaining the Elements of an Image of a Person"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cBCyRXC1-Tw?si=lN9P2xo0hsfyD8K6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> That said, these chatbots follow different restrictions. My AI generally has fewer rules than ChatGPT—it might perform a broader range of tasks.</p><h2 id="2-Conversations-Retain-the-Last-3-000-Words"><a href="#2-Conversations-Retain-the-Last-3-000-Words" class="headerlink" title="2. Conversations Retain the Last 3,000 Words"></a>2. Conversations Retain the Last 3,000 Words</h2><p> Contextual memory helps AI provide more accurate responses. Instead of taking prompts at face value, chatbots will reference relevant information in active conversations. Let’s say you’re looking for side hustles. AI-driven chatbots will also consider your skills and career background, assuming you provide them.</p><p> Of course, all platforms have limited contextual memory. But what’s impressive about My AI is that it shares the same high<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-token-limit-can-you-exceed-it/" >token limit as ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Take this conversation as an example. We asked My AI to roleplay a fictional character. It maintained the instructed persona even after receiving 2,000+ words of irrelevant information. Other platforms may have dropped prior instructions by this point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-my-ai-roleplay-request.jpg"                      alt="Snapchat My AI Roleplaying as Ash Ketchum from Pokemon"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-my-ai-continuing-roleplay-request.jpg"                      alt="Snapchat My AI Continuing the Roleplay Request to Portray Ash from Pokemon"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="3-My-AI-Can-Pull-Real-Time-Information"><a href="#3-My-AI-Can-Pull-Real-Time-Information" class="headerlink" title="3. My AI Can Pull Real-Time Information"></a>3. My AI Can Pull Real-Time Information</h2><p> My AI has some access to real-time data. Although it has trouble answering specific questions about current events, it can quickly pull general information online, such as weather forecasts, news headlines, and local events.</p><p> Here’s My AI providing the weather forecast for Manila, Philippines. Google and Snapchat use different units of measurement, but they’re essentially the same after conversion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/manila-weather-forecast-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="Asking Snapchat About the Weather Tomorrow in Manila"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/manila-weather-forecast-google.jpg"                      alt="Searching the Weather Forecast for Manila on Google"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> Try testing the limits of My AI’s accuracy.

It can tell you which establishments and landmarks are near your current location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-location-test.jpg"                      alt="Asking Snapchat About Nearby Gas Stations"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fm0XhU5H8R4?si=cFPk6XK3X3CQSI7Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-location-suggestions.jpg"                      alt="Snapchat Suggesting Nearby Gas Stations"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> Just note that Snapchat also displays your active location if you enable GPS services. But you can turn off this feature to ensure more privacy, Click your avatar on the top-left corner of the screen, then go to &gt;<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Privacy Controls</strong> &gt;<strong>My Location</strong> . Toggle the Ghost Mode button to hide your location.</p><h2 id="5-My-AI-Solves-Intermediate-Word-Problems-Correctly"><a href="#5-My-AI-Solves-Intermediate-Word-Problems-Correctly" class="headerlink" title="5.

My AI Solves Intermediate Word Problems Correctly</h2><p> A<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-bing-ai-vs-google-bard/" >side-by-side comparison of ChatGPT, Bard AI, and Bing Chat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> shows that AI chatbots struggle with math questions. ChatGPT answers intermediate to advanced math problems better than competitors.</p><p> While Bard AI and Bing Chat use more advanced LLMs than Snapchat, My AI surprisingly does well in Math.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-word-problem-probability.jpg"                      alt="Asking Snapchat a Probability and Statistics Math Problem"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-riddle-family-relatives.jpg"                      alt="Asking Snapchat a Riddle About Family Relatives"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> Try rephrasing word problems that My AI answers wrong.

Initial users responded poorly to My AI—it faced backlash for its faulty training and restrictions.<a class="link"   href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/14/snapchat-myai/" >The Washington Post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> even showed the chatbot providing harmful advice.</p><p> These incidents shouldn’t have happened in the first place, but in fairness to Snapchat, it quickly resolved My AI’s security issues. The company enforced stricter guidelines shortly after these reports.</p><p> Snapchat also adds new features consistently. Take My AI’s image prompting feature as an example. The chatbot is getting way better at recognizing images, even ones you take yourself. Meanwhile, other chatbots have yet to adopt image prompting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Jfq2Wx1Bcs?si=YQrYpTy0g4aV5QaO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Try-Snapchat’s-New-AI-Assistant"><a href="#Try-Snapchat’s-New-AI-Assistant" class="headerlink" title="Try Snapchat’s New AI Assistant"></a>Try Snapchat’s New AI Assistant</h2><p> My AI was initially limited to Snapchat+ subscriptions.

If you’re a small business owner, there are plenty of ways to use this AI tool to boost your small business’s productivity and efficiency.</p><h2 id="1-Create-Content"><a href="#1-Create-Content" class="headerlink" title="1. Create Content"></a>1. Create Content</h2><p> Whether you’re crafting a blog for your business website or scripting a video for your brand’s YouTube channel, ChatGPT can be your go-to content creator. This is particularly valuable for small businesses that may not yet have the budget for a dedicated content writer.</p><p> If you’re struggling to come up with a topic for your blog, ChatGPT can aid with brainstorming. The key is<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/prompting-techniques-to-improve-chatgpt-responses/" >creating detailed prompts with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Just share details like your audience and their buying stage and get tailored suggestions from the tool.</p><p> If you already have a specific idea or topic, you can flesh it out and tell ChatGPT what you want it to include in the content. From there, it can create article outlines, suggest titles, or even draft an entire blog. With an existing outline, ChatGPT can populate it with content, leaving you to simply fact-check and refine it.</p><p> While it may seem easy to outsource everything to ChatGPT, you should merely use it as a starting point. It’s critical to add your personality to any content that carries the brand of your business.</p><h2 id="2-Generate-Social-Media-Posts-Out-of-Existing-Content"><a href="#2-Generate-Social-Media-Posts-Out-of-Existing-Content" class="headerlink" title="2.

Don’t worry; ChatGPT can help populate your message templates. If you don’t have a template yet, you can ask ChatGPT to make one.</p><p> Just copy and paste your template into ChatGPT, ensuring it has all the necessary placeholders. Supply it with all it needs to fill in the placeholders and let it fill in the template. Once ChatGPT finishes generating a personalized message for each customer, all that’s left for you to do is copy and send them to your customers.</p><h2 id="4-Make-Text-Excel-Friendly"><a href="#4-Make-Text-Excel-Friendly" class="headerlink" title="4.

Transferring this data into an Excel sheet can be a laborious and time-consuming process.</p><p> ChatGPT can help you move all your data into Excel seamlessly. If your data is in a text format, you can copy-paste it directly into ChatGPT. If your inventory is in a handwritten note,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/convert-handwriting-text-ocr/" >scan the handwritten note and copy its text with OCR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Paste the text into ChatGPT and instruct it to make columns based on your preference.

Just provide the text and specify the formatting you want. These include:</p><ul><li>Capitalization changes (for example, formatting all titles into uppercase or title case)</li><li>Change date formats (for example, mm-dd-yy to dd-mm-yyyy)</li><li>Convert comma-separated lists to a bullet point</li><li>Replace specific words or phrases in a text</li><li>Remove multiple spaces between words</li><li>Change the emphasis of words (such as italicizing all prices in a list)</li><li>Change currency formats</li><li>Obfuscate emails (for example, <a class="link"   href="mailto:&#99;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x74;&#97;&#99;&#116;&#x40;&#109;&#117;&#111;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;" >&#99;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x74;&#97;&#99;&#116;&#x40;&#109;&#117;&#111;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to contact[at]muo[dot]com</li><li>Format numbers (for example, 60000 to 60,000)</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aknYnDfODro?si=zONIVzA9FFq0rLOD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Translate-Languages"><a href="#6-Translate-Languages" class="headerlink" title="6.

Thankfully, ChatGPT can assist with language translation. Copy-paste the text and ask the AI tool to translate it into your native language. Simply input the text and request its translation into your preferred language. Also, if you’re unsure of a language, ChatGPT can help<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-language-is-this-5-online-tools-to-identify-almost-every-unknown-language/" >identify unknown languages for you <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> too.</p><h2 id="7-Write-Personalized-Emails"><a href="#7-Write-Personalized-Emails" class="headerlink" title="7.

If writing personalized emails is part of your strategy to gain new customers and nurture existing customers, ChatGPT can help you make them. You can also use it to develop various versions of follow-up emails, providing flexibility and options if the initial outreach does not receive a response.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XA_wP7rS9ww?si=LarMG3sEHAhSoL6q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Create-FAQ-Lists"><a href="#8-Create-FAQ-Lists" class="headerlink" title="8.

This can offer insights into what your customers are likely to inquire about. ChatGPT can also provide draft answers, leaving you to refine or correct them as needed.</p><h2 id="An-AI-Assistant-for-Your-Small-Business"><a href="#An-AI-Assistant-for-Your-Small-Business" class="headerlink" title="An AI Assistant for Your Small Business"></a>An AI Assistant for Your Small Business</h2><p> If you’re just starting a new business and don’t have the funds to hire an assistant, ChatGPT can greatly help smoothen your business operations, from general administrative tasks to content creation and marketing. But you still have to be careful with it’s use, because it’s not perfect. Review every document you create and iron out the mistakes.

The opening keynote, which took place on Monday, focused almost entirely on the buzzword we can’t stop talking about – <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-to-know-about-apples-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >artificial intelligence (AI) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-to-know-about-apples-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >Everything to know about Apple’s AI features coming to iPhones, Macs, and iPads <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>After trailing behind major players like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, Apple unveiled a slew of AI features spread across the company’s most popular operating systems. While AI was the event’s main focus, Apple executives also announced this year’s software upgrades for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, and Vision Pro.</p><p>If you couldn’t tune into the two-hour-long event, ZDNET has you covered.

The release puts generative models at the heart of the ecosystem of Apple devices.</li><li>With Apple Intelligence, your iPhone can <strong>prioritize notifications</strong> to ensure you get notified only when it’s crucial throughout your day.</li><li>The release includes <strong>writing tools</strong> that leverage AI, including rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text features available across mail, keynotes, third-party apps, and more.</li><li>Users can now create <strong>personalized images</strong> in the photo library, including sketches, illustrations, and animations. This feature is available in Messages, Apps, Freeform, Keynote, and Pages.</li><li>Apple Intelligence can tap into tools and <strong>carry out tasks on your behalf</strong>, such as “Show me all the photos,” “Play the podcast,” or “Pull the files that my coworker shared with me last week.”</li><li>Because it’s grounded in your personal information and context, and can retrieve data from across your apps and reference the content on your screen, Apple Intelligence is positioned to be your <strong>personal assistant</strong>.</li><li>Apple emphasized the <strong>safety and privacy precautions</strong> built into Apple Intelligence, particularly for on-device intelligence processing. The company touted the security of Apple’s silicon, A17 Pro, and its M family of chips (M1, M2, M3, and M4).</li><li>For tasks that are too large for on-device processing and need to be completed in the cloud, Apple unveiled <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-apples-keeping-your-cloud-processed-ai-data-safe-and-why-it-matters/" >Private Cloud Compute <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, which protects users’ privacy by running on servers specially created using Apple Silicon. When users make requests, Apple Intelligence first tests on-device capability, but calls on Private Cloud Compute if the task requires more power. Apple reiterated that user data is never stored or sold to external parties.</li><li><strong>Siri</strong> finally got the AI makeover it deserves, first with a new look: when tapped, light wraps around the edges of your screen. Siri can now <strong>better understand users</strong>, even if they stutter, due to more advanced natural language processing (NLP). It now has <strong>conversational</strong> <strong>context</strong>, remembering what you just said and using it to complete the next task. Users can also <strong>type requests to</strong> <strong>Siri</strong>. Because it has <strong>in-depth product knowledge</strong>, Siri can answer questions about functionality on iPad, iPhone, and Mac. Siri will also have Apple Intelligence’s <strong>on-screen awareness</strong>, allowing it to act on what it sees. The voice assistant can also <strong>take actions</strong> across apps, including photo editing. With access to your <strong>personal context,</strong> Siri can understand and complete new commands, such as pulling your driver’s license information from a photo and inputting it into a form. The Siri updates are coming to iPad and Mac, too.</li><li>Apple Intelligence also powers new features in <strong>Mail</strong>, including <strong>Rewrite</strong>, which offers users different versions of what they have already drafted. <strong>Suggestions</strong> are shown in-line, and <strong>Proofread</strong> edits forgrammar, word choice, and sentence structure. You can also use <strong>Summarize</strong> to convert your text into bullet points. <strong>Smart Reply</strong> identifies relevant selections of an email and uses them to help craft a custom message. Summaries will now appear at the top of emails, making browsing an inbox easier. Apple Intelligence can even help <strong>prioritize</strong> your emails, placing what is most important at the top of your inbox.</li><li>There is an all-new focus option: <strong>reduce interruptions</strong>. When in this setting, your phone will only show you what is most important based on your personal activity and context.</li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-generated-genmoji-solve-a-problem-weve-all-had-before/" >Genmoji <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> allows users to create <strong>AI-generated emojis</strong> based on what they type. You can also create a Genmoji based on a photo of a friend. Genmojis can be included in-line in Messages and even used for Tapbacks.</li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-dall-e-apples-new-ai-image-generator-runs-on-device-and-works-like-magic/" >Image Playground <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> allows users to leverage AI on-device to create images from text prompts, which can be easily shared in iMessage and elsewhere. The feature is also available in Keynote, Pages, and Freeform, and as a stand-alone <strong>Image Playground app.</strong></li><li><strong>Image Wand in the Notes app</strong> transforms a rough sketch into a polished image and is available directly in the tool palette. For example, you can circle a rough sketch in Notes and open Image Playground to transform your doodle into a fully-fledged image.</li><li>Apple Intelligence will also upgrade the Photos app with a new <strong>clean-up tool</strong> that removes unwanted objects. <strong>Search in videos</strong> allows users to easily find specific snippets of content, and users can create <strong>Memories</strong> on-demand, using text to edit and organize photos into movies.</li><li>In the Notes app, users can <strong>record and transcribe audio</strong>, which Apple Intelligence will generate a text summary of. This experience is also available in the Notes phone app.</li><li>Apple Intelligence is free on iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and MacOS Sequoia, and will be available to try in English only this summer.</li></ul><h2 id="Partnership-with-OpenAI"><a href="#Partnership-with-OpenAI" class="headerlink" title="Partnership with OpenAI"></a>Partnership with OpenAI</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><ul><li>Apple also confirmed its partnership with OpenAI by integrating <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-chatgpt-and-why-does-it-matter-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" >ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with Siri. With a user’s permission, Siri can send a request to ChatGPT for help.

In the patent, Apple shares that the controllers would work with a headset, and even includes a visual of the headset that resembles Apple Vision Pro, as seen below. </p><p>Apple</p><p>According to the patent, the handheld controller would be used for “gathering information on controller motions such as swiping motions, waving motions, writing movements, drawing movements, shaking, motions, rotations, etc, and may include wireless communications circuitry for communicating with external equipment such as a head-mounted device.” </p><p>The patent also includes an image of the controller, which looks like an Apple Pencil and differs from the standard headset controllers currently on the market such as the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/meta-quest-3-review/" >Meta Quest 3’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the PlayStayion VR2’s controllers. </p><p>Apple</p><p>The benefit of using controllers is that they offer much more precision, which is especially needed for professionals relying on the headset for tasks such as 3D content creation and engineering. When Sony recently unveiled its <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/sonys-new-xr-headset-is-more-pro-than-vision-pro-and-has-2-features-apple-needs/" >XR headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, ZDNET’s Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/sonys-new-xr-headset-is-more-pro-than-vision-pro-and-has-2-features-apple-needs/" >noted <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that the headset sported two things he wished the Apple Vision Pro had, including wearable controllers. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-releases-ios-17-4-with-podcast-transcripts-new-emojis-and-eu-app-store-changes/" >Apple releases iOS 17.4 with podcast transcripts, new emojis, and EU app store changes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Even though the idea of a controller for the Apple Vision Pro sounds promising, don’t get too excited just yet. Companies file many patents every year and only some of these ever see the light of day. There’s a possibility that the controllers aren’t going to be made at all or – if they are – it won’t be anytime soon. </p><h4 id="Apple"><a href="#Apple" class="headerlink" title="Apple"></a>Apple</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-hands-on/"  title="iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you&#39;ll get">iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you’ll get <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ios-18-settings-i-changed-immediately-and-why-you-should-too/"  title="6 iOS 18 settings I changed immediately - and why you should too">6 iOS 18 settings I changed immediately - and why you should too <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-hands-on/"  title="iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you&#39;ll get">iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you’ll get <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ios-18-settings-i-changed-immediately-and-why-you-should-too/"  title="6 iOS 18 settings I changed immediately - and why you should too">6 iOS 18 settings I changed immediately - and why you should too <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-essential-techniques-for-logitech-webcam-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential Techniques for Logitech Webcam Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-smile-with-these-top-funny-tiktok-videos-and-jokes/"><u>[New] Smile with These Top Funny TikTok Videos and Jokes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-selecting-text-enhancement-websites-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Selecting Text Enhancement Websites for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-rapidly-rise-as-a-social-media-star-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] Rapidly Rise as a Social Media Star on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/free-3gp-video-converter-factory-vs-pro-edition-key-differences-explored/"><u>Free 3GP Video Converter Factory Vs.

Understandably, this dissuasive argument may lead you to avoid ChatGPT. But there are alternative ways to use the tool. Here, we look at some ways you can use ChatGPT without an OpenAI account.</p><h2 id="1-Bing-Chat"><a href="#1-Bing-Chat" class="headerlink" title="1. Bing Chat"></a>1.

But with this growing AI prevalence, should you be at all concerned about your mental health? Will AI improve or worsen mental health across the board?</p><h2 id="How-Can-AI-Improve-Mental-Health"><a href="#How-Can-AI-Improve-Mental-Health" class="headerlink" title="How Can AI Improve Mental Health?"></a>How Can AI Improve Mental Health?</h2><p> AI is already a big deal in a number of industries, including healthcare, transport, and finance. But you may not know that AI is also being experimented with in the mental health realm.</p><p> Through this, researchers may be able to find new ways of supporting mental health patients and developing better forms of treatment. At the time of writing, AI is still in its infancy in terms of mental health applications, but this technology has a lot of potential in the mental healthcare industry.</p><p> So, how, exactly, might AI prove useful here, and in what ways may it pose a risk?</p><h3 id="Providing-Instant-Advice-and-Support-Using-AI"><a href="#Providing-Instant-Advice-and-Support-Using-AI" class="headerlink" title="Providing Instant Advice and Support Using AI"></a>Providing Instant Advice and Support Using AI</h3><p> Finding a therapist can take a long time, and can even be an inaccessible option for some due to its high cost. So, when someone needs advice and support immediately, who can they turn to?</p><p> There are hotlines for those seeking support, but talking to a real person about your problems can be daunting. So, using artificial intelligence, an individual may be able to access advice remotely without having to talk to a real person. This can alleviate the social anxiety associated with discussing personal issues, while also ensuring that the person struggling receives some form of support.</p><p> While regular chatbots can be used in such a scenario, an AI-powered chatbot will likely have the ability to communicate in a more personal way, further understand a person’s issue, and provide possible solutions or avenues. We’ve already seen how the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chat-gpt-generative-ai-explained/" >ChatGPT chatbot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can interact with users, so there’s likely some potential here for patient support.</p><p> Of course, some may see<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/dangers-using-ai-free-therapist-psychiatrist/" >using AI to provide mental health advice as risky <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . We’ll discuss the possible downsides of this a little later.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gyGoQi7hsZk?si=8OcKcPUj2wSBmVZ1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Monitoring-Patient-Progress-With-AI"><a href="#Monitoring-Patient-Progress-With-AI" class="headerlink" title="Monitoring Patient Progress With AI"></a>Monitoring Patient Progress With AI</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/stetho-laptop-1.jpg"                      alt="person typing on laptop next to stethoscope on desk"                ></p><p> Monitoring a patient’s progress to ensure they’re not taking steps backward is a very important step in recovery. While a human professional can do this well, the number of individuals requiring mental health support makes it difficult for human personnel to keep up with the demand.</p><p> This is where AI might be able to help. Using this technology, a patient could give inputs on how they’re feeling and what they’ve been doing, and an AI system could then assess and evaluate the information provided to determine whether there is any cause for concern. The AI system could then alert the relevant parties so that action can be taken. This may lower the occurrences of mental health negligence, as a far greater number of people could be assessed regularly without the need for a human professional.</p><p> But there are risks to consider here, and the AI system in use would have to be very thoroughly trained on how to spot possible red flags. Still, simply using this as an initial assessment could prove highly beneficial, both to doctors and patients.</p><h3 id="Developing-New-Support-Techniques-With-AI"><a href="#Developing-New-Support-Techniques-With-AI" class="headerlink" title="Developing New Support Techniques With AI"></a>Developing New Support Techniques With AI</h3><p> There’s no denying that researchers are still working to further understand our brains and why they give way to mental illnesses. Not only is the origin of mental illness still being researched, but techniques on how to better treat patients are also being developed.</p><p> For example, an AI system may be able to take a batch of data about patient symptoms, triggers, or backgrounds, and then suggest new ways to help them make progress. This could be a medication suggestion, a kind of therapy, or similar.</p><p> On top of this, AI has been proven to detect the presence of mental illnesses with a relatively high rate of accuracy. In a<a class="link"   href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt9gx593b0/qt9gx593b0%5FnoSplash%5Fd814b6b41c76cb874050695d2bf30ced.pdf" >2019 psychiatry report by IBM and the University of California <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it was stated that, when testing AI in mental illness detection, accuracy ranged from 62 to 92 percent (depending on the AI system and training data used). While the lower ends of this range aren’t too impressive, continued development may allow AI systems to reach a consistently high accuracy rate when detecting mental illnesses.</p><p> Though this all seems very promising, there are also<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/is-ai-dangerous-5-immediate-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/" >dangers associated with using AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the mental health field and other ways that AI can worsen mental health in general.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xa2_mFu-obA?si=_xDGF1pv-dnuaDOr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Can-AI-Worsen-Mental-Health"><a href="#How-Can-AI-Worsen-Mental-Health" class="headerlink" title="How Can AI Worsen Mental Health?"></a>How Can AI Worsen Mental Health?</h2><p> While AI has significant potential to improve mental healthcare, there are also risks and dangers in the adoption of this fast-evolving technology.</p><h3 id="Increased-Reliance-on-AI"><a href="#Increased-Reliance-on-AI" class="headerlink" title="Increased Reliance on AI"></a>Increased Reliance on AI</h3><p> Over the past few decades, the rise of smart technology has led many people to rely on phones, PCs, tablets, and other devices to simplify and enhance their lives. Whether they’re chatting on social media, streaming movies, browsing for new clothes, or simply getting some work done, technology usually stands as the backbone. Many people are even<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/smartphone-addiction-how-overcome-negative-habit/" >addicted to their smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or computers, which can have a huge impact on their lives.</p><p> So, when AI becomes prominent across various industries, it could have a detrimental effect on mental health. For instance, an individual may opt to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-teachers-embrace-ai/" >use AI for their education <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , work, entertainment, and other elements of their social life. This, in turn, may lead to something of an AI addiction. There are already plenty of people addicted to social media, online shopping, and online gaming today, which can often give way to feelings of anxiety and very real social and financial problems.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bofw6eJA7Bg?si=HM2gKZGH4L1otw3e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Lack-of-Human-Contact"><a href="#Lack-of-Human-Contact" class="headerlink" title="Lack of Human Contact"></a>Lack of Human Contact</h3><p> Humans are, by nature, social beings. So, it can often be hugely beneficial to discuss your feelings with somebody else, instead of dealing with them alone.</p><p> But if AI becomes increasingly used in the mental health industry, accessing face-to-face treatment, such as talking therapy, may become even more challenging than it currently is. If AI is too frequently used as a replacement for human contact, a decline in recovery rates and patient progress may occur as a result.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hands-reaching-1.jpg"                      alt="hands reaching out to each other"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nGlyEL5K6Y?si=3KZhTTBvKcPmyS68" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> At the moment, humans are seen as much more effective at conducting therapy than machines, and this may always be the case. This is why the application of AI in the mental health field should be regulated and monitored very carefully so that patients are still receiving the best care possible.</p><h3 id="AI-Giving-Faulty-Advice-or-Solutions"><a href="#AI-Giving-Faulty-Advice-or-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="AI Giving Faulty Advice or Solutions"></a>AI Giving Faulty Advice or Solutions</h3><p> While AI is capable of some amazing things, it is also vulnerable to errors. This is a big concern when AI is being entrusted with people’s mental health. Misjudging someone’s state of mind, offering ineffective treatment, or misinterpreting important data could be catastrophic for the patient, so there are major considerations that need to be made here.</p><p> There are plenty of things that can go wrong while using AI, particularly as it is in its early stages. System malfunctions, software bugs, and improper training can all lead to issues, with malicious attacks also posing a possible risk.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9hsPbiic0O8?si=58mZ2Cu6wicQfsUP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="AI’s-Future-in-Mental-Health-Must-Be-Watched-Carefully"><a href="#AI’s-Future-in-Mental-Health-Must-Be-Watched-Carefully" class="headerlink" title="AI’s Future in Mental Health Must Be Watched Carefully"></a>AI’s Future in Mental Health Must Be Watched Carefully</h2><p> AI has so much potential that it’s no secret why people are so excited about it. However, as is the case with any emerging technology, it is crucial that AI is not too quickly applied or outright misused. In mental healthcare, this could do more harm than good to patients. Time will tell if, or when, AI becomes a key element in the mental health industry and whether this turns out to be a blessing or a curse.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-lens-legends-choosing-the-best-10-camera-optics/"><u>[Updated] Lens Legends Choosing the Best 10 Camera Optics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expert-strategies-for-backdrop-displacement-in-photoshops-offspring-affinity-photo/"><u>2024 Approved Expert Strategies for Backdrop Displacement in Photoshop's Offspring, Affinity Photo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transform-your-photos-into-musical-masterpieces-withwithout/"><u>2024 Approved Transform Your Photos Into Musical Masterpieces (With/Without)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/choosing-between-myai-and-chatgpt-for-your-snapchat-needs/"><u>Choosing Between MyAI and ChatGPT for Your Snapchat Needs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/enhancing-client-trust-in-financial-institutions-with-abbyy-id-proofing-and-confirmation-services/"><u>Enhancing Client Trust in Financial Institutions with ABBYY ID Proofing and Confirmation Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-much-for-grok-elon-sheds-light-on-cost-of-cutting-edge-ai/"><u>How Much for Grok? - Elon Sheds Light on Cost of Cutting-Edge AI</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-issue-of-unsuccessful-dvd-ripping-using-dvd-decrypter/"><u>How to Fix the Issue of Unsuccessful DVD Ripping Using DVD Decrypter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-to-shield-sensitive-information-from-potential-exposure-by-personalized-gpts-like-chatgpt/"><u>How to Shield Sensitive Information From Potential Exposure by Personalized GPTs Like ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-docs.techidaily.com/how-to-use-handbrake-for-easy-blu-ray-conversion-step-by-step-guide/"><u>How To Use Handbrake For Easy Blu-Ray Conversion - Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-unreliable-are-artificial-intelligence-systems-in-spotting-duplicate-articles/"><u>How Unreliable Are Artificial Intelligence Systems in Spotting Duplicate Articles?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/microsofts-revolutionary-easy-fix-laptops-spark-buzz-challenge-rivals-apple-watches-closely-zdnet/"><u>Microsoft's Revolutionary Easy Fix Laptops Spark Buzz, Challenge Rivals (Apple Watches Closely) | ZDNET</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/perfected-text-templates-for-professional-use/"><u>Perfected Text Templates for Professional Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/pioneering-the-next-wave-in-ai-discover-openais-game-changing-gpt-4-model/"><u>Pioneering the Next Wave in AI: Discover OpenAI’s Game-Changing GPT-4 Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/tech-intrusion-activisions-fault-line/"><u>Tech Intrusion: Activision's Fault Line</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/the-complete-tutorial-for-installing-microsoft-copilot-on-your-apple-computer/"><u>The Complete Tutorial for Installing Microsoft Copilot on Your Apple Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-fixing-squad-microphone-problems/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Fixing Squad Microphone Problems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/top-dialogue-titans-clash-gemini-ultimate-vs-plus-gpt/"><u>Top Dialogue Titans Clash: Gemini Ultimate V/S Plus-GPT</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Now it sports a 2x Telephoto option for taking clear pictures from far away. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/" >The 5 best iPhone 16 Pro features that enthusiasts will care about <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Below the power button is a new tactile switch called <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/" >Camera Control <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is a special sensor allowing you to control the camera with a few light touches. A light tap instantly opens the Camera app and a few more light touches can be used to adjust the composition. You can zoom in on a subject, adjust the exposure, or change the depth of view. The best part of Camera Control is it’ll soon become accessible on third-party apps.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBWcw6rXIdg?si=Tlue44bW-bPA4tH9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Eye-catching-colors"><a href="#3-Eye-catching-colors" class="headerlink" title="3. Eye-catching colors"></a>3. Eye-catching colors</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Every generation of iPhones brings with it new colors. For this release, Apple decided to go bold. The shades are some of the most vibrant we’ve seen in the series, especially that bubble-gum Pink iPhone. You also have the option to go for Ultramarine Blue or muted Teal Green. Of course, you still have the classic options of Black and White. </p><p>The Pro models go for a more striking design. Desert Titanium adorns their brushed metal, making the iPhones look like they’ve been forged from bronze. If you prefer something a little more low-key, the Pro models are available in the equally impressive Black, White, and Natural Titanium too.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E1ax-vnGdeo?si=bgTkOhOEwDTlRQE3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Design-changes-bring-other-benefits"><a href="#4-Design-changes-bring-other-benefits" class="headerlink" title="4. Design changes bring other benefits"></a>4. Design changes bring other benefits</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>There’s more to the iPhone 16’s design besides color as Apple made multiple changes. We’ve already talked about the camera array and the Camera Control switch. What you may not know is the company made its mobile device tougher. It is covered in the “latest-generation Ceramic Shield”, making the iPhone 16 15% more durable than before. The glass has also been twice as tough to withstand drops.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-be-updated-to-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/" >Every iPhone model that will be updated to Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones won’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple even updated the iPhone 16’s internal design, allowing the device to dissipate heat better. This means lower internal temperatures, which results in a healthier battery. The optimization allowed for more room, too, resulting in an even larger battery. The base model can last up to 22 hours on a single charge. The Action Button makes a return, giving users quick access to various functions, from activating the Translate tool to turning on Shazam.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/"  title="20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really">20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/"  title="Want a programming job?

However, the big question remains: can ChatGPT truly make a difference in patient care and treatments?</p><p> With ChatGPT, healthcare providers can organize patient data, translate medical terminology, and manage information efficiently. But, before using it, you must ensure it is absolutely safe for handling people’s precious health.</p><h2 id="What-Is-the-Role-of-ChatGPT-in-Public-Health"><a href="#What-Is-the-Role-of-ChatGPT-in-Public-Health" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Role of ChatGPT in Public Health?"></a>What Is the Role of ChatGPT in Public Health?</h2><p> NLP (Natural Language Processing) is not a brand-new concept in the healthcare sector. The industry has been using systems similar to—though not as user-friendly as—ChatGPT for a while to handle the vast amount of data they deal with daily.</p><p> However, NLP systems are used by healthcare professionals, not patients. Medical professionals use these systems, whether custom-made or from third-party providers, for tasks like organizing medical documents and conducting research with data.</p><p> ChatGPT is also an NLP tool, but it’s not your ordinary chatbot—it is quite advanced, and various industries have already embraced it to make their work seamless and solve tricky challenges.</p><p> What makes ChatGPT special is that it is simpler, user-friendly, and can have human-like conversations. Although both ChatGPT and existing NLP systems in healthcare are not perfect, they can help meet the growing demands of patient care worldwide. NLP is one of the important<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/medical-technologies-future-healthcare/" >medical technologies shaping healthcare’s future <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wiIVztRIqQ?si=GBgdwQ78k5hbeFDv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Use-ChatGPT-in-Healthcare"><a href="#How-to-Use-ChatGPT-in-Healthcare" class="headerlink" title="How to Use ChatGPT in Healthcare"></a>How to Use ChatGPT in Healthcare</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jonathan-kemper-mmuzs5qzuus-unsplash.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rxyki8-Y630?si=dHLkIxG59zdlZeN0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Currently, ChatGPT is mainly used in the administrative side of healthcare, and it’s proving to be a game-changer for healthcare professionals. It can do many things to make their lives easier, like handling paperwork, checklists, and logs. In a recent survey by<a class="link"   href="https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/nursing/nurses-say-distractions-cut-bedside-time-25" >Jackson Healthcare <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , most nurses admitted spending 25% of their shift on non-patient tasks, and ChatGPT aims to reduce that burden.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gSKkJrJ57EA?si=WDOmInPE9EgQa_tB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Using-ChatGPT-to-Sort-Unstructured-Data"><a href="#Using-ChatGPT-to-Sort-Unstructured-Data" class="headerlink" title="Using ChatGPT to Sort Unstructured Data"></a>Using ChatGPT to Sort Unstructured Data</h3><p> Unstructured data in the medical field includes things like clinical notes, patient feedback, and medical literature. While you can read it, it becomes hard to search once it piles up in hundreds of documents saved by doctors. As a result, you can’t get valuable insights from this data, which is crucial for diagnosis and medical care.</p><p> ChatGPT can quickly analyze massive amounts of data—even diagnostics data. Just ask it a specific question with the sorting criteria you need, and it will give you the structured data you are looking for. You can copy its response, save it on a notepad, and open the file in Microsoft Excel to finish the process—problem solved!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3AGmFrtBLHw?si=VhvpUaXHPBHl6OT6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Remote-Patient-Monitoring-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#Remote-Patient-Monitoring-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Remote Patient Monitoring With ChatGPT"></a>Remote Patient Monitoring With ChatGPT</h3><p> Even though doctors can’t be with their patients all the time, patients need to keep track of their symptoms. This is where remote patient monitoring comes in. Patients track vital signs—like blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose levels—and share this data with their doctor. The doctor then reviews the information and provides feedback to the patient. It’s a way to stay connected and care for patient health even when not in the same place.</p><p> But clinicians receive a lot of vital signs data from patients every single day, which can be overwhelming to examine. Luckily, ChatGPT can analyze the information collected by home health monitoring systems and provide clear insights for both patients and healthcare professionals. All patients have to do is share their results, and ChatGPT will let them know if everything is normal or not. After all, ChatGPT passed the USMLE exam!</p><h3 id="ChatGPT-as-a-Virtual-Assistant-for-Patient-Care"><a href="#ChatGPT-as-a-Virtual-Assistant-for-Patient-Care" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT as a Virtual Assistant for Patient Care"></a>ChatGPT as a Virtual Assistant for Patient Care</h3><p> ChatGPT can be like having a personal assistant available all the time for doctors. It can handle client communication, schedule appointments, and even help create emails. Moreover, you can rely on it to summarize clinical notes and the patient’s medical history, making your preparation for visits much easier. And with ChatGPT-4’s plugin feature, using it has become even simpler. Here’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-install-and-use-chatgpt-plugins/" >how you can make the most of ChatGPT plugins <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KXVWj6Ar1M?si=Cd_jktmoN3e9OzH3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT-Has-Potential-in-Healthcare-But-Be-Careful"><a href="#ChatGPT-Has-Potential-in-Healthcare-But-Be-Careful" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Has Potential in Healthcare, But Be Careful"></a>ChatGPT Has Potential in Healthcare, But Be Careful</h2><p> In the future, ChatGPT might be helpful in patient care and other medical areas. But remember, it doesn’t have a medical classification system because it’s not specifically designed for healthcare.</p><p> So, it’s better to avoid relying on it for crucial healthcare tasks like diagnoses and treatments because it can sometimes make mistakes and give incorrect information.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-syncing-yt-beats-with-visual-timelines/"><u>[New] Syncing YT Beats with Visual Timelines</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-youtube-visual-impact-mastering-thumbnail-dimensions/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, YouTube Visual Impact Mastering Thumbnail Dimensions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-beat-boosting-elevate-your-ig-videos-with-the-right-tune/"><u>2024 Approved Beat Boosting Elevate Your IG Videos with the Right Tune</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/bridging-the-gap-between-board-games-and-artistry-with-chatgpts-my-bot-insights/"><u>Bridging the Gap Between Board Games & Artistry with ChatGPT's My Bot Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/decoding-the-innovations-in-googles-latest-llm-venture-the-plm-2-model-explained/"><u>Decoding the Innovations in Google's Latest LLM Venture: The PLM 2 Model Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/discover-how-the-chatgpt-ios-version-outperforms-the-web-interface-6-reasons-why/"><u>Discover How the ChatGPT iOS Version Outperforms the Web Interface: 6 Reasons Why</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/discover-the-top-benefits-of-snapchats-my-ai-beyond-a-novelty-gadget/"><u>Discover the Top Benefits of Snapchat's My AI: Beyond a Novelty Gadget</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/harnessing-gpts-potential-for-eq-improvement/"><u>Harnessing GPT's Potential for EQ Improvement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-transfer-text-messages-from-htc-u23-to-iphone-1514131211x8-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Transfer Text Messages from HTC U23 to iPhone 15/14/13/12/11/X/8/ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-efficient-techniques-to-record-your-idevice/"><u>In 2024, Efficient Techniques to Record Your iDevice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-hassle-free-ways-to-remove-frp-lock-from-oppo-a1-5g-phones-withwithout-a-pc-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock from Oppo A1 5G Phones with/without a PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-inside-the-innovations-a-detailed-look-at-powerdirector-24-release/"><u>In 2024, Inside the Innovations A Detailed Look at PowerDirector '24 Release</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-navigating-video-landscape-vimeo-and-youtube-distinguished/"><u>In 2024, Navigating Video Landscape Vimeo and YouTube Distinguished</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/professional-note-taking-strategies-using-chatgpt-simplified/"><u>Professional Note-Taking Strategies Using ChatGPT Simplified</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-chargetechs-27000mah-battery-backup-solution/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to ChargeTech's 27000mAh Battery Backup Solution</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

View at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Over the past week, I’ve been exercising, traveling, and sleeping with the new <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-ultra&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Apple Watch Ultra 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find out exactly where the company has pushed the envelope this time around. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >Best Apple Watches of 2023: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I’ll cut right to the chase: If you already own an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-vs-ultra-is-it-time-to-upgrade/" >Apple Watch Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, there is no compelling reason to upgrade to the Ultra 2. But if you’re one of the many who are planning to buy an Ultra wearable for the first time, this is as good as it gets. Here’s why.</p><p>Given today’s economic environment with rising consumer prices, I am a bit surprised that Apple was able to hold the price of the new Watch Ultra 2 at the same level as last year. When you consider the titanium construction, integrated LTE radio, and sapphire glass display, $799 is very reasonable for a high-performance sports watch. That’s more true when you compare the Apple Watch Ultra 2 to other flagship GPS sports watches. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>As far as what’s new with the model, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 incorporates a faster S9 processor, a brighter display, twice the internal storage, and a series of recycled materials that, somehow, don’t make the wearable feel any bit worse. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-issues-emergency-security-updates-for-iphone-ipad-and-apple-watch/" >Apple issues security fixes for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch to fight Predator spyware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>WatchOS 10 was released when the Watch Ultra 2 was announced and it’s made the Apple Watch experience an absolute joy to use, with new functions for the side button and digital crown (Smart Stack), along with spacious and info-rich watch faces that are optimized for the Watch Ultra models.</p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Naturally, I placed the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-vs-ultra/" >Watch Ultra 2 next to my first-gen Watch Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and they were virtually indistinguishable from each other. After cranking up the brightness of both, I could barely tell the difference in standard lighting conditions due to Apple’s implementation of the same ambient light sensor. But in the outdoors, which is where you’ll be leveraging the Watch Ultra’s technologies the most, it was apparent that the Ultra 2 was significantly brighter (3,000 nits compared to 2,000 nits).</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-tips-2023/" >Apple pro tips: The best new features in iPhone 15, iOS 17, and Apple Watch unlocked <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Prior to the Watch Ultra 2 launch, I listed <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-three-features-that-would-make-me-upgrade-from-the-last-model/" >three features that I wanted to see <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to warrant an upgrade, and while Apple did not provide them, it did address one of my desires in a unique manner. The LED flashlight on <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-garmin-watch/" >Garmin watches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a tool that I use daily. On the Watch Ultra 2, once you turn on the flashlight, spinning the digital crown now ups the maximum brightness, making use of the extra nits. </p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>It still doesn’t beat out the Garmin LED, but it is much more practical than last year’s for finding things in the garage or under the bed, illuminating rooms at night, and finding your way in the dark outside.</p><p>Mapping, unfortunately, is still limited on the Apple Watch Ultra 2, with the most notable change being offline maps support, provided you have an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-every-iphone-that-will-get-ios-17/" >iPhone on iOS 17 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. However, the Compass app has also received a subtle yet significant upgrade thanks to watchOS 10. On the Watch Ultra 2, it now shows a waypoint for the last-detected cellular and emergency SOS locations, so you know exactly where to return to if you find yourself in a dead zone. The Compass app also lets you mark your camping spot, parking spot, and other useful waypoints.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apple-weaved-ai-into-the-iphone-15-and-apple-watch-9/" >How Apple weaved AI into the iPhone 15 and Apple Watch 9 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Alongside Watch Ultra 2, Apple released new carbon-neutral watch bands, with three colors being offered across the Alpine Loop and Trail Loop bands. I had a chance to test the gray&#x2F;green Trail Loop with the Watch Ultra 2, and all I can say is that it’s extremely comfortable. I bought my Watch Ultra with an Ocean band last year but will likely pick up the Trail Loop this time around due to its easy Velcro secure support. For more casual outings, it’s the ideal watch band.</p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Finally, as much as I enjoy the Apple Watch Ultra 2 for its long battery life, brighter display, expanded connectivity, and new watch bands, I’ve also been enjoying the improved mental health functionality via the Mindfulness app. It has now earned a prominent spot in my app list, and I’ve been entering my state of mind on a daily basis. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-watchos-10-feature-is-overlooked-underrated-and-life-changing/" >My favorite WatchOS 10 feature is overlooked, underrated, and life-changing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I now frequently use the Reflect and Breathe utilities, which have slowly but surely reduced my stress, proving to be a welcome addition to my Apple Watch use. (Of course, you only need an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> running on watchOS 10 to use the Mindfulness app. I just like using it on the larger display of the Ultra!)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y3VlwHTQQMs?si=BXYwD1pKiaTuev4y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ZDNET’s-buying-advice"><a href="#ZDNET’s-buying-advice" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET’s buying advice"></a>ZDNET’s buying advice</h2><p>With my primary SIM now living as an eSIM in the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro/6.7-inch-display-256gb-natural-titanium-unlocked&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 Pro Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHX9N594?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ccf051f5e-8c27-4aef-8ea0-13f4f3fd2a79%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Apple Watch Ultra 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be staying on my wrist for an extended period of time – likely until the next Ultra version comes out. Apple’s improvements this year don’t push the envelope in any particular way, but they’re well-rounded enough to make the Watch Ultra still the best flagship sports watch that enthusiasts should buy.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/" >The best smartwatches of 2023: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If you don’t have an Apple Watch Ultra but are interested in buying one, the Ultra 2 is the best option.

With seemingly so much power, can it design effective workouts for you, as well?</p><p> By comparing the AI chatbot’s workout plans to similar exercises and routines available now on websites and apps, it’s easy to see what the chatbot gets right as well as highlight its potential weak spots. Here’s what to know about ChatGPT and its use in the fitness realm.</p><h2 id="What-Is-ChatGPT"><a href="#What-Is-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="What Is ChatGPT?"></a>What Is ChatGPT?</h2><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/" >AI chatbot ChatGPT works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by generating natural-sounding responses to prompts that you type. Although this type of technology has existed for a while, ChatGPT in particular is notable for its (mostly) accurate and intelligent responses.</p><p> Despite a few limitations—the chatbot has limited information about the world after about 2021—it’s useful for summarizing books, writing a resume, debugging code, and much more. But does it have enough information to design a workout plan for you? Here’s how ChatGPT responded to common requests for three different types of workout plans.</p><h2 id="Basic-Workout-Plans-From-ChatGPT"><a href="#Basic-Workout-Plans-From-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Basic Workout Plans From ChatGPT"></a>Basic Workout Plans From ChatGPT</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-workout-plan-for-beginners-prompt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT workout plan for beginners prompt"                ></p><p> For the first prompt, I asked ChatGPT to create a workout plan for beginners. The basic workout plan it generated allotted time for cardio, resistance training, warm-ups, and cool-downs.</p><p> For the most part, it looks like a solid plan that you might find on any<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-beginner-workout-apps-fitness-newbies/" >beginner-friendly workout app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , such as the J&amp;J Official 7 Minute Workout. There’s even a note at the end to increase your duration slowly over time and stay hydrated, which is excellent advice for any athlete.</p><p> In this instance, ChatGPT responded to the prompt with a standard list of exercises that would work well for many people. If you’re interested in a simple, straightforward fitness routine, then its suggestions are legitimate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-workout-plan-for-advanced-athletes-prompt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT workout plan for advanced athletes prompt"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bofw6eJA7Bg?si=HM2gKZGH4L1otw3e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Meanwhile, a second plan for more seasoned athletes follows a similar format, including plenty of examples for cardio, core, and resistance training. Each section includes many options.</p><p> For instance, you can decide to use resistance bands or weights for strength training or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and cycling for cardio work.</p><p> A note reinforcing the importance of rest and recovery helps make sure you aren’t overtraining as well. Again, it’s a dependable plan to increase your baseline fitness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chat-gpt-injury-recovery-prompt.jpg"                      alt="Chat GPT injury recovery prompt"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q_69vX9wnRE?si=FtLxkpRhPORqcMeE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> What if you are recovering from an injury? It’s safest (and always recommended) to consult your doctor for any specific questions about how you can exercise with an injury or other health concern, but I wanted to see how the bot would respond.</p><p> Wisely, this response also includes a prompt to listen to your healthcare provider, so ChatGPT covers its bases in that way. It also encourages you to stretch gently, incorporate low-impact activities where appropriate, and avoid pushing too hard right away.</p><p> As someone who has recovered from a fair share of sports injuries, this is the same kind of advice I received from physicians and physical therapists when returning to activities. Again, nothing can replace personalized advice from a healthcare provider, but the chatbot gets the broad strokes correct and advises caution.</p><h2 id="How-ChatGPT-Creates-Running-Plans"><a href="#How-ChatGPT-Creates-Running-Plans" class="headerlink" title="How ChatGPT Creates Running Plans"></a>How ChatGPT Creates Running Plans</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-running-plan-question-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT running plan question screenshot"                ></p><p> Next, I prompted the chatbot to create a running plan. It responded with several questions about my current fitness level, as well as overall training goals, to generate a more detailed response.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-10k-running-plan-prompt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT 10K running plan prompt"                ></p><p> I responded to the questions in order, and it provided a multi-week plan. The plan is actually pretty solid, even taking potential injuries into account, but it didn’t get into more granular details like pacing.</p><p> If your goal focuses on speed (such as running a 10K in less than an hour), then you may want a plan that targets a certain pace. In this example, you’d need to hold around a 9:30&#x2F;mile pace to complete the 10K in under one hour.</p><p> Even with a few attempts at follow-up questions, the chatbot did not respond with any specific pacing information. Compared to similar<a class="link"   href="https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a30911910/download-your-runners-world-training-plan/" >training plans from Runner’s World <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the ChatGPT responses are not quite as detailed; however, they do offer basic plans that can help you get ready for specific distances.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-boston-qualifier-prompt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Boston qualifier prompt"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXLLPY11of0?si=-3YNnpnO0wbc0K_-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> However, there is some level of self-awareness with ChatGPT’s advice on this topic (if you can say such a thing about AI technology). For instance, if you ask it to create a running plan that will help you qualify for the Boston Marathon, then it directs you to find an online plan that already addresses this ambition. It’s a huge, years-long goal, even for many talented runners, and the app rightly doesn’t attempt to offer a pat response.</p><p> While ChatGPT provides adequate training plans for runners, there are many free resources for running plans online that offer much more detail. In time, however, it’s likely the chatbot will be able to provide more in-depth plans that take pacing, heart rate zones, and more information into account.</p><h2 id="Strength-Training-Plans-From-ChatGPT"><a href="#Strength-Training-Plans-From-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Strength Training Plans From ChatGPT"></a>Strength Training Plans From ChatGPT</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-strength-training-prompt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT strength training prompt"                ></p><p> Likewise, ChatGPT’s general strength training plan is also pretty dependable, calling for bodyweight exercises like squats and push-ups as well as dumbbell rows. It’s similar to what you might find from<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-weightlifting-apps/" >top strength-training apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> What if you have more specific questions about how to perform the exercises correctly? The chatbot can help with that, too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-deadlifts-prompt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT deadlifts prompt"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOyLy8DeizY?si=GkAmK0hChZw6_2tW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> In this example, I received detailed instructions on the correct way to do deadlifts. It offered helpful pointers about your stance, grip, and even breathing techniques in order to make the most of this particular exercise.</p><p> If you ever need to double-check the way to perform a certain exercise, or simply try out a new series of strength workouts, then ChatGPT is a helpful resource. The simple, straightforward responses and training plans offer a lot of information for beginner and more experienced athletes looking to increase their strength.

Rather, Apple is now moving further into AI language models. </p><p>Last Thursday, Apple released <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/apple/DCLM-7B" >DCLM-Baseline-7B <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a 7 billion parameter language model, on Hugging Face. The model is part of the DataComp for Language Models (DCLM) benchmark, an initiative to improve the quality of training datasets for language models.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-try-gpt-4o-mini-3-ways-to-access-the-smarter-cheaper-ai-model-and-2-are-free/" >Want to try GPT-4o mini? 3 ways to access the smarter, cheaper AI model - and 2 are free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>At 7 billion parameters, this model is comparable to popular models such as Llama 2, Gemma, and more. When tested on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark against popular models around the same size, DCLM-Baseline-7B performed competitively, even outperforming Mistral 7B, as seen below. </p><p>Apple&#x2F;Hugging Face</p><p>Despite its impressive performance, one of the DCLM-Baseline-7B’s biggest standouts is that the model is truly open-sourced, with “open data, open weight models, open training code,” as highlighted by Vaishaal Shankar, a research scientist at Apple. </p><blockquote><p>We have released our DCLM models on huggingface! To our knowledge these are by far the best performing truly open-source models (open data, open weight models, open training code) 1&#x2F;5</p><p>— Vaishaal Shankar (@Vaishaal) <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/Vaishaal/status/1813956553042711006?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" >July 18, 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></blockquote><p>Many are commending Apple for this approach as it allows other researchers and developers to build on the models and further grow advancements in the space. The model was trained on the <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlfoundations/dclm-baseline-1.0" >DCLM-BASELINE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> data, combined with <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/starcoderdata" >StarCoder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="http://proofpile2/" >ProofPile2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>data, to reach proficiency in other tasks such as coding and math.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-can-be-updated-to-apples-new-ios-18-public-beta-and-which-ones-cant/" >Every iPhone model that can be updated to Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones can’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In addition to releasing DCLM-Baseline-7B, model weights, training code, and dataset, Apple also included a powerful 1.4 billion parameter version in the package. </p><p>This isn’t Apple’s first go-around with AI models, having released others such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-model-can-understand-your-home-screen-and-supercharge-siri/" >Ferret-UI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a multimodal large language model (MLLM), and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-claims-its-on-device-ai-system-realm-substantially-outperforms-gpt-4/" >Reference Resolution As Language Modeling (ReALM) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a conversational AI system.

One such feature that doesn’t get nearly the attention it should is called Focus. With Focus, you define what notifications are shown when a particular Focus is active. Say, for example, you create a focus called Writing, where you require an absolute minimum amount of distractions. However, there is one particular contact (say your agent or your spouse) that you do want to allow as a distraction (for obvious reasons). With Focus, you can do just that – create a focus that will only allow those notifications you specific to be able to interrupt your flow.</p><p>And we all know how important flow is. A few seconds of setback can take you minutes to recover from (especially when you’re in the zone). </p><p>So, how do you create this custom Flow? Let me show you. All you’ll need to make this work is either a MacBook Pro&#x2F;Air or an iMac running macOS Monterey or newer. With such a device at the ready, let’s get our Focus on.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NC0rdKEQ98o?si=HYgqC8CxF_WTO5if" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Create-a-custom-Focus"><a href="#Create-a-custom-Focus" class="headerlink" title="Create a custom Focus"></a>Create a custom Focus</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAnyQ0uj9Yg?si=Es4_ulcdM_-LuDcq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Open-System-Preferences"><a href="#1-Open-System-Preferences" class="headerlink" title="1.
