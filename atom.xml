A little over two years later, the company has finally refreshed the Mac Mini line with its updated <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-debuts-m2-pro-and-m2-max-the-chipsets-powering-this-years-best-macs/" >M2 and M2 Pro chips <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Of course, this means the latest Mini is once again capable of new tasks it couldn’t handle before, and able to handle its existing ones faster than ever. So, where does this leave the already somewhat niche <a class="link"   href="https://go.shopyourlikes.com/pi/31863f23ab888f7d75e0148c7814ab136d06da0d?afId=614548&afCampaignId=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp&afCreativeId=2993&afPlacementId=2" >Mac Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that debuted between the M1 and M2 generations of Mac Mini?</p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-mac-mini-with-m2-chip-is-faster-more-capable-and-somehow-cheaper/"><strong>Apple’s new Mac Mini with M2 is faster, more capable, and somehow cheaper</strong></a></p><p>The far more expensive unit arrived with a starting price of <a class="link"   href="https://go.shopyourlikes.com/pi/8aebe3f6fe3b12241b0cd2c89da2c524bf9b9e4c?afId=614548&afCampaignId=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp&afCreativeId=2993&afPlacementId=2" >$2,000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a choice between M1 Max or M1 Ultra chips. Instinctually, these older model chips might seem like they should be inferior to the second-gen M2 and M2 Pro chips. However, the reality is far more complex and well worth understanding before you decide which of these devices might best suit your specific needs. </p><p>Below I’ve included three reasons why each one could be the best fit for the right user. By the end, you should have a much clearer picture of why the Mac Studio still has a place in this world, as well as why the M2 Mac Mini is a bigger bargain than ever.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Mac Mini</strong></th><th><strong>Mac Studio</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Base chip options</td><td>M2 (8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine) or M2 Pro (10-core CPU , 16-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine)</td><td>M1 Max (10-core CPU, 24-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine) or M1 Ultra (20-core CPU, 48-core GPU, 32-core Neural Engine)</td></tr><tr><td>RAM options</td><td>8-24GB (M2 models) or 16-32GB (M2 Pro model)</td><td>32-64GB (M1 Max model) or 64-128GB (M1 Ultra model)</td></tr><tr><td>Storage options</td><td>256GB-2TB (M2 models) or 512GB-8TB (M2 Pro model)</td><td>512GB-8TB (M1 Max model) or 1-8TB (M1 Ultra model)</td></tr><tr><td>Ports</td><td>2x Thunderbolt 4, 2x USB-A, 1x HDMI, 1x Gigabit Ethernet, headphone jack</td><td>Front: 2x USB-C or 2x Thunderbolt 4 (M1 Ultra model) and 1x SDXC card reader | Rear: 4x Thunderbolt 4, 2x USB-A, 1x HDMI, 1x 10Gb Ethernet port, headphone jack</td></tr><tr><td>Supported displays</td><td>2 (1x Thunderbolt, 1x HDMI) on M2 models, 3 (2x Thunderbolt, 1x HDMI) on M2 Pro models</td><td>5 (4x Thunderbolt, 1x HDMI)</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless connectivity</td><td>Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3</td><td>Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td>1.41 x 7.75 x 7.75 inches (3.58 x 19.7 x 19.7 cm)</td><td>3.7 x 7.7 x 7.7 inches (9.5 x 19.7 x 19.7 cm)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>M2: 2.6lbs | M2 Pro: 2.8lbs</td><td>M1 Max: 5.9lbs | M1 Ultra: 7.9lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum power draw</td><td>M2: 150W | M2 Pro: 185W</td><td>All models: 370W</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Starting at $599 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td><td><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-studio&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Starting at $1,999 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr></tbody></table><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHafwnWSEQk?si=rejNVNpJZH2SqNLy" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-should-buy-Apple’s-Mac-Mini-M2-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-Apple’s-Mac-Mini-M2-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy Apple’s Mac Mini (M2) if…"></a>You should buy Apple’s Mac Mini (M2) if…</h2><p>The M2 Mac Mini is pretty much physically identical to its M1 predecessor, at least on the outside.</p><p>CNET</p><h3 id="1-You-want-a-home-computer-that-just-works"><a href="#1-You-want-a-home-computer-that-just-works" class="headerlink" title="1.

I personally use an M1 Mac Mini for some heavy-duty photo editing and mid-range video editing without ever feeling constrained. Now, with the 20% faster (according to Apple) M2, or 12-core M2 Pro at its heart, the Mac Mini has even more headroom for you to take on projects that would bog down many <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-all-in-one-computer/" >other home PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

For this, you get an M2 model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. If that’s a bit too restrictive, the 512GB model is only $200 more. Even the top-end M2 Pro model remains just over half the cost of the Mac Studio’s <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-studio&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >$2,000 base price <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>Sure, you can kit out an M2 Pro Mac Mini with absurd specs to bring its price all the way up to $4,500.

You only need two (or three) displays</h3><p>One of the few complaints about the M1 Mac Mini at launch was the fact that it only supported two displays (one via Thunderbolt 4 and one via HDMI), despite older Intel-based models having supported more. It’s an issue that I’ve <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/how-to-add-second-thunderbolt-monitor-to-m1-mac-mini/" >personally tried to help readers find a workaround for <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Unfortunately, Apple retained that same two-display limitation for the M2 Mac Mini. If you opt for the M2 Pro model, that number rises to three (with an extra Thunderbolt 4 display supported). It’s rare that home users need more than a triple-monitor setup, but it’s worth noting, especially when two of those three displays will need to support Thunderbolt input.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Buy Apple’s Mac Mini (2023) $600 at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="You-should-buy-Apple’s-Mac-Studio-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-Apple’s-Mac-Studio-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy Apple’s Mac Studio if…"></a>You should buy Apple’s Mac Studio if…</h2><p>As its name would suggest, the Mac Studio was very much designed for the creative professional.</p><p>Apple</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43goO8X0iX0?si=48Cqf6td2q_6T6h3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-You-want-the-fastest-Apple-silicon-desktop-available"><a href="#1-You-want-the-fastest-Apple-silicon-desktop-available" class="headerlink" title="1. You want the fastest Apple silicon desktop available"></a>1. You want the fastest Apple silicon desktop available</h3><p>Despite the M2 being considered a generation ahead of M1 models, the fastest SoC (System on Chip) Apple currently offers in a desktop remains its M1 Ultra. That will be true, at least, until the just-announced M2 Max chip makes its way into a desktop, if not longer. The dominance of the M1 Ultra is due in large part to the fact that the SoC is essentially two M1 Max chips operating in parallel. While it doesn’t exactly mean twice the performance of the M1 Max, it does come close enough that it can go toe to toe with any other chip Apple or almost anyone else for that matter offers. We’ll have to wait for the full benchmarks of the M2 Max to arrive before we know if it can dethrone the M1 Ultra.</p><p><strong>Review: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-mac-studio-review/" >Apple Mac Studio with M1 Ultra: A workstation-class upgrade Mac users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><h3 id="2-You-need-ports-lots-of-‘em"><a href="#2-You-need-ports-lots-of-‘em" class="headerlink" title="2. You need ports, lots of ‘em"></a>2. You need ports, lots of ‘em</h3><p>The Mac Mini’s available ports are probably fine for most users, and even some professionals and creatives. However, any content creator could tell you how rapidly ports can fill up when you’re connecting things like mics, cameras, external storage, A&#x2F;V capture devices, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/how-to-choose-the-right-monitor-layout-for-work/" >multiple displays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, control surfaces, mice, keyboards and the bevy of other peripherals involved in higher-end media production. </p><p>This kind of demand will quickly outstrip the two USB-A and two Thunderbolt 4 ports on the Mini. Sure, you could opt for various <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop-docking-station/" >docks, hubs, and the like <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but for the best performance and stability, you’ll want a system that can natively handle all of your hardware. The Mac Studio’s vast array of I&#x2F;O options can do just that. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/this-75-dock-turns-your-mac-mini-into-a-mac-studio-sort-of/" >This $75 dock turns your Mac Mini into a Mac Studio (sort of) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5gTm5KxtQ0?si=onF1rBS2nEM5nLGg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-You-need-to-power-more-than-three-displays"><a href="#3-You-need-to-power-more-than-three-displays" class="headerlink" title="3.

You need to power more than three displays</h3><p>This one might be a bit obvious given the #3 entry above, but if you want to power more than three displays, you’ll have to opt for the Mac Studio. Both the M1 Max and M1 Ultra model support five displays: four via Thunderbolt and one via HDMI. This should be more than enough for even the most demanding creative, obsessive day trader, or stereotypical movie hacker (though they’d probably be running Linux or something). The M1 Ultra version of the Mac Studio even supports outputting two displays via its front-facing Thunderbolt 4 ports.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-mac/" >The 6 best Macs of 2023 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-studio&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Buy Apple’s Mac Studio (2022) $2,000 at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Alternatives-to-consider"><a href="#Alternatives-to-consider" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to consider"></a>Alternatives to consider</h2><p>Open to other desktop PC prospects?

As <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/10/apple-alerts-iphone-users-in-98-countries-to-mercenary-spyware-attacks/" >spotted by TechCrunch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on Wednesday, Apple sent an email warning individuals in the crosshairs that they “are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID.” The email also listed the specific ID for each individual who received it.</p><p>The email explained that the attack is likely targeting each potential victim because of who they are or what they do.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-and-remove-spyware-from-your-phone/" >Removing spyware from your phone can be tricky. These options are your best bet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>“Although it’s never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning – please take it seriously,” Apple added in its message.</p><p>This is the second such warning that Apple has issued in 2024. In April, the company sent out a similar alert to targeted iPhone users, cautioning them about mercenary spyware attacks directed against them. At the same time, Apple updated its support page on <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102174" >threat notifications and mercenary spyware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The page explains how mercenary spyware attacks work, how Apple will alert its users if they’re the victims of such an attack, and what to do if you’re targeted by this kind of attack.</p><p>Apple</p><p>So just what is a mercenary spyware attack, and should the average iPhone user be concerned? On the one hand, most iPhone users will never be targeted by these types of attacks. On the other hand, such an attack could prove devastating for you, since a successful attacker can remotely control and steal sensitive data from your device.</p><p>Typically carried out by, or on behalf of, nation states, such attacks are usually launched against individuals with specific roles in society, such as journalists, activists, politicians, and diplomats. The goal is often to strike back at someone because of what they did or said, especially if it runs afoul of a government, a political leader, or another type of authority.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-dark-web-monitoring-service-will-soon-be-free-for-users-heres-how-to-use-it/" >Google’s dark web monitoring service will soon be free for all users - here’s how to use it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>More advanced and complex than your average cybercrime, a mercenary spyware attack usually targets a few people. The attacks can still cost millions of dollars, according to Apple, and are often short-lived, creating a challenge for anyone attempting to detect and stop them. While these attacks are rare, Apple has sent out threat notifications multiple times per year since 2021, notifying people in more than 150 countries.</p><p>“It’s really important to recognize that mercenary spyware, unlike others, is deliberately designed with advanced capabilities, including zero-day exploits, complex obfuscation techniques, and self-destruct mechanisms, making it highly effective and hard to detect,” Krishna Vishnubhotla, VP of product strategy at mobile security provider Zimperium, told ZDNET back in April. “Operating in stealth is key to its success. The developers of mercenary spyware go to great lengths to remove any clues that might link the software back to them or their clients.” </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Probably the best known spyware for these types of attacks is Israel-based NSO Group’s Pegasus, which has been used in mercenary spyware campaigns against noted <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nso-spyware-found-targeting-journalists-and-ngos-in-el-salvador/" >journalists <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nso-spyware-used-to-hack-polish-politicians-wife-of-khashoggi-un-war-crimes-investigator-and-more/" >politicians <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and other individuals. The NSO Group typically skirts any responsibility, claiming that the firm sells Pegasus only to intelligence and law enforcement agencies and that Pegasus can only be used against terrorists and criminals.</p><p>Apple and other companies have nevertheless <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-sues-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/" >sued the NSO Group <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for its role in state-sponsored attacks. Apple has also been forced to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-launches-bug-fixes-for-iphone-ipad-apple-watch-and-mac-to-combat-pegasus-spyware/" >create and deploy bug fixes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch to shore up vulnerabilities exploited by Pegasus.</p><p>Although such attacks are often state-sponsored, Apple <a class="link"   href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/apple-warns-users-mercenary-spyware-attack-91-countries-including-india-et-2024-04-11/" >removed that term from its alert and from the latest update to its support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, after facing pressure from the Indian government about linking such breaches to state actors, a source with direct knowledge told Reuters. The support page does, however, still state that “individually targeted attacks of such exceptional cost and complexity have historically been associated with state actors.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-out-if-an-airtag-is-tracking-you/" >How to find out if an AirTag is tracking you <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How would you know if you’re being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack? If Apple determines that you’re a potential victim, you’ll receive an email and a text message with an alert. A threat notification will also appear at the top of <a class="link"   href="https://appleid.apple.com/" >your Apple ID page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after you sign in.</p><p>Apple suggests that all iPhone users take the following steps to protect themselves from spyware and similar threats:</p><ul><li>Protect your device with a passcode.</li><li>Safeguard your Apple ID with two-factor authentication and a strong, secure password.</li><li>Update your device to the latest OS version, which usually includes the newest security fixes.</li><li>Install apps only from the App Store.</li><li>Use strong and unique passwords for all your online accounts.</li><li>Don’t click on links or attachments from unknown senders.</li></ul><p>You can also protect yourself against such attacks by turning on <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-previews-lockdown-mode-a-new-extreme-security-feature/" >Lockdown Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which disables or limits key features and settings to prevent spyware from stealing sensitive data. In the event of an attack, Apple recommends that you also reach out to experts, such as the rapid-response emergency security assistance offered by the <a class="link"   href="https://www.accessnow.org/help/" >Digital Security Helpline at the nonprofit group Access Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security"></a>Security</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"  title="The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested">The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-turn-on-private-dns-mode-on-android-and-why-you-should/"  title="How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should)">How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-antivirus/"  title="The best antivirus software and apps you can buy">The best antivirus software and apps you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-router/"  title="The best VPN routers you can buy">The best VPN routers you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-and-remove-spyware-from-your-phone/"  title="How to find and remove spyware from your phone">How to find and remove spyware from your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"  title="The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested">The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-turn-on-private-dns-mode-on-android-and-why-you-should/"  title="How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should)">How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android (and why you should) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-antivirus/"  title="The best antivirus software and apps you can buy">The best antivirus software and apps you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-router/"  title="The best VPN routers you can buy">The best VPN routers you can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-and-remove-spyware-from-your-phone/"  title="How to find and remove spyware from your phone">How to find and remove spyware from your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-maximizing-youtube-shorts-earnings-essentials-and-profit-prospects/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Maximizing Youtube Shorts Earnings Essentials and Profit Prospects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-effortless-melodies-free-facebook-download/"><u>[New] In 2024, Effortless Melodies Free Facebook Download</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-boost-engagement-with-creative-video-titling-and-tagging-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Boost Engagement with Creative Video Titling and Tagging Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-number-8s-expert-image-fusion-web-utility/"><u>[Updated] Number 8'S Expert Image Fusion Web Utility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/evaluating-ai-engineers-which-is-more-capable-chatgpt-or-gemini-the-coding-duel-explained/"><u>Evaluating AI Engineers: Which Is More Capable, ChatGPT or Gemini?

And that’s because you’re using a Windows PC and not a Mac.</p><p>Mac owners can easily sync their online iCloud content using a convenient and simple built-in MacOS feature. But Windows users have faced challenges in this process. With no iCloud syncing tool built into Windows, your only option has been the iCloud for Windows app. And this always felt like an app that Apple threw together haphazardly just to placate Windows users.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cloud-storage/" >The best cloud storage services <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For those of you who haven’t yet tried iCloud for Windows, the app lets you sync specific items stored in iCloud online to your Windows PC. In that vein, it offers several key features.</p><p>You can access and view your synced iCloud photos in the Microsoft Photos app for <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-11-faq-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can keep your photos up to date across your PC, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/" >iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Plus, you’re able to create shared albums that other people can view.</p><p>If you enable iCloud Drive, you can see and access your online folders and files directly in File Explorer. You’re also able to share files and automatically sync any changes to your files.</p><p>The app lets you sign in to websites using credentials you’ve stored in iCloud Keychain. You can access all your passwords and create new ones in the iCloud Passwords app, which is automatically added when you install iCloud for Windows. The iCloud Passwords extension also works in the desktop versions of Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. You can even generate verification codes to sign in to websites.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-access-and-sync-icloud-notes-on-linux/" >How to access and sync iCloud notes on Linux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>And there’s more. You’re able to view your iCloud calendars and contacts directly in Microsoft Outlook. And you can sync your bookmarks from Safari with the iCloud bookmarks extension in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.</p><p>If you already have a previous version of iCloud for Windows, the new version will automatically be installed the next time you open the app. If you don’t yet have it, head to its <a class="link"   href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PKTQ5699M62?hl=en-US&gl=US" >Microsoft Store page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download and install it.</p><p>After launching the app and signing in the first time, the setup screens will ask you which content you wish to sync. You can opt to sync your iCloud photos to the Microsoft Photos app, sync iCloud Drive to File Explorer, sync your passwords in iCloud Keychain, sync your Safari bookmarks, and sync your iCloud calendars and contacts with Outlook.</p><p>After the setup is complete, you’re placed at the newly-redesigned iCloud for Windows screen. Here, you can clearly see the syncing status of each type of content and choose which ones to turn on or off. The screen also shows you how much total space you’ve used in iCloud and how much is free.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/" >The best laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Is the new iCloud for Windows a dramatic improvement over its predecessor? A few people chiming in at the Microsoft Store have complained of syncing problems and other glitches. But an equal number have given the overhaul five-star ratings. Some reports say the app overall works better in Windows 11 than in <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-your-windows-10-pc-be-saved-in-2025-yes-for-free-heres-how/" >Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, especially the photo, contacts, and calendar syncing.</p><p>In my testing, the app ran smoothly in Windows 11 with no hiccups. It did crash once in Windows 10 when I was trying to sync my iCloud photos, but otherwise, it’s been behaving. At the very least, it already seems like a decided improvement over the old version.</p><h4 id="Apple"><a href="#Apple" class="headerlink" title="Apple"></a>Apple</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-hands-on/"  title="iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you&#39;ll get">iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you’ll get <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ios-18-settings-i-changed-immediately-and-why-you-should-too/"  title="6 iOS 18 settings I changed immediately - and why you should too">6 iOS 18 settings I changed immediately - and why you should too <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-hands-on/"  title="iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you&#39;ll get">iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you’ll get <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ios-18-settings-i-changed-immediately-and-why-you-should-too/"  title="6 iOS 18 settings I changed immediately - and why you should too">6 iOS 18 settings I changed immediately - and why you should too <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-tips-for-incorporating-songs-in-your-fb-story/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Tips for Incorporating Songs in Your FB Story</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-skillful-use-of-skypes-screen-share-capabilities-in-telecommuting/"><u>[Updated] Skillful Use of Skype's Screen Share Capabilities in Telecommuting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ions-tech-the-ultimate-gaming-toolkit-for-2024/"><u>Champion's Tech The Ultimate Gaming Toolkit for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/cutting-edge-code-helpers-top-7-alternatives-to-chatgpt/"><u>Cutting-Edge Code Helpers: Top 7 Alternatives to ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/edit-and-send-fake-location-on-telegram-for-your-xiaomi-redmi-12-5g-in-3-ways-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Edit and Send Fake Location on Telegram For your Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G in 3 Ways | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/first-captured-visual-saga-critique-with-alternate-views/"><u>First Captured Visual Saga Critique with Alternate Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-screen-mirroring-tecno-phantom-v-flip-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Screen Mirroring Tecno Phantom V Flip?

Your options are a Pro or an Air, but which one is better? Apple’s been busy refreshing its MacBook lineup: the company has added more new MacBook configurations over the past few years, and with new processors coming every year, there have never been more factors to consider when buying a new Apple laptop. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-apple-macbook-is-getting-a-free-upgrade-here-are-the-best-macos-15-features/" >Your Apple MacBook is getting a free upgrade - here are the best MacOS 15 features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>When buying a MacBook, you’ll want to consider the computer’s display size, storage capacity, computing power, and price. For example, the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/13-inch-m2&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >2022 13-inch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/13-inch-m3&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >2024 13-inch MacBook Air <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are both Air models with different chips, so the laptops vary in performance, efficiency, and battery life.</p><p>The most recent MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models include Apple’s M3 chips, which are even more efficient and capable than the M2 chips. In this situation, think of yourself as Goldilocks; you’re confronted with five different MacBook models, but you need to find the one that’s just right for you. So, before you decide which one to buy, let’s cover the main differences between the Pro and the Air.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Compare MacBooks at Apple View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c17xsnbinCQ?si=xHKslFgC3QbxY4qW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What’s-the-difference-between-the-MacBook-Pro-and-Air"><a href="#What’s-the-difference-between-the-MacBook-Pro-and-Air" class="headerlink" title="What’s the difference between the MacBook Pro and Air?"></a>What’s the difference between the MacBook Pro and Air?</h2><p>Believe it or not, there are many major differences between the MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air. The biggest differences are pricing and computing power. The most affordable M3 MacBook Pro will cost more than the most affordable M3 Air, but the M3 Pro will be more powerful, thanks to the upgraded internals under the hood.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-laptops/" >How we test laptops at ZDNET <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The M3 MacBook Pro models have more unified memory, longer battery life, more ports (including HDMI and SD card), and a more sophisticated GPU and CPU than their Air counterparts. There are two MacBook Pro display sizes: <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >14-inch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >16-inch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The M3 MacBook Pro has improved internal computing parts for greater efficiency and performance. The M3 family has three chips: M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. The M3 models have improved media engines to handle video playback. The M3 chips have the same number of CPU and GPU cores and neural engines as the M2 chips, and both the base M2 and M3 chips can support the same amount of unified memory.</p><p>According to Apple, the M3 chips are 15% faster than the M2 chips, so if you recently upgraded to an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-macbook-pro-m2-max-review/" >M2 MacBook Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you’re not eons behind on computer power.</p><p>Here’s the 16-inch MacBook Pro.</p><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>If you’re looking for a new 13-inch MacBook Pro, Apple unfortunately discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro after releasing the new 14-inch MacBook Pro. As a result, you can no longer purchase a 13-inch MacBook Pro on Apple’s website. Apple also discontinued the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M2 Pro and M2 Max chips.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-apple-products-you-shouldnt-buy-this-month-especially-these-iphones/" >6 Apple products you shouldn’t buy this month <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>You can upgrade the current 14-inch Pro with Apple’s new M3 Pro and M3 Max chips if the base M3 chip isn’t powerful enough. However, If you’re going big with the 16-inch Pro, understand that your only options are the M3 Max or M3 Pro chips, which will bump up the price tag.</p><p>The upgraded chipsets are more powerful than the base M2 chips found in the 2022 13-inch MacBook Air. These upgraded chips make the 14-inch and 16-inch Pro suitable for editing pro-grade video footage (up to 8K), rendering 3D art, producing music, and editing high-resolution photos in Adobe Photoshop.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/m3-macbook-air-review/" >M3 MacBook Air review: Apple’s AI computer for the masses has arrived <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>However, the more power you want with the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, the more expensive the laptop becomes. The 14-inch Pro starts at <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-m3-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >$1,599 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and, with chip and internal storage upgrades, can go up to $3,199. The 16-inch Pro starts at <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >$2,499 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and, with internal upgrades, goes up to $3,999.</p><p>If you’ve decided you want a MacBook Pro and need more guidance determining which Pro model works best for you, check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/m3-macbook-pro-buying-advice/" >ZDNET’s M3 MacBook Pro buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The 2022 13-inch MacBook Air only comes equipped with Apple’s base M2 chip, and the 2024 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air only come with the base M3 chip. However, the lack of Pro and Max chips doesn’t mean the Air is a less-than-capable computer. The MacBook Air is thinner and lighter than the Pro because it has less internal hardware, dismissing for-work ports like HDMI, an SD card slot, and a cooling fan. Instead, Apple is banking on the efficiency of its chips to keep the laptops’ heat dissipated and stabilized.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/macbook-pro-m3-max-review/" >MacBook Pro (M3 Max) review: Apple’s pro AI laptop is a chart-topper in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>And, of course, less hardware means the MacBook Air is less expensive, but you can add a few upgrades. For the 13-inch Air, you can choose between two M2 chip configurations, as one M2 chip has two more GPU cores than the other. An upgraded GPU means your computer can process graphics more efficiently, making 4K video editing faster and smoother.</p><p>Last summer, Apple announced a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-m3-macbook-air-last-years-fantastic-15-inch-model-is-200-off-right-now/" >15-inch MacBook Air with an M2 chip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but discontinued the device with the introduction of the M3 15-inch Air. Although the 15-inch M2 Air had a short run, it’s still a great option for those looking for an Air with up-to-date capabilities. However, you can’t purchase it brand new from Apple. You can buy it <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/G18S3LL/A/refurbished-15-inch-macbook-air-apple-m2-chip-with-8%25E2%2580%2591core-cpu-and-10%25E2%2580%2591core-gpu-starlight?cid=aos-us-seo-pla-refurb-refurb_mac&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >refurbished from Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or you can buy it new for a <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-air-15-laptop-m2-chip-8gb-memory-256gb-ssd-space-gray/6534599.p?skuId=6534599&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >discounted price at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>The M3 13-inch Air starts at <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/13-inch-m2&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >$1,099 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and goes up to $1,499 if you max out the internal storage and pick a more powerful GPU.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Embrace-the-Future-with-Apple-Discover-What-You’re-Losing-by-Ignoring-the-Upgrade-to-iPhone-15-Exclusive"><a href="#Embrace-the-Future-with-Apple-Discover-What-You’re-Losing-by-Ignoring-the-Upgrade-to-iPhone-15-Exclusive" class="headerlink" title="Embrace the Future with Apple: Discover What You’re Losing by Ignoring the Upgrade to iPhone 15  Exclusive"></a>Embrace the Future with Apple: Discover What You’re Losing by Ignoring the Upgrade to iPhone 15  Exclusive</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/697248e08e4c86f81b229afb62b264cd0bb172dc/2024/03/27/adf95394-715b-4911-a043-a925524574d9/image-top-apple-wants-you-to-know-what-youre-missing-by-not-upgrading-to-an-iphone-15.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280"                      alt="Apple&#39;s new page lets you compare the iPhone 15 with the 11 and 12 models"                ></p><p>Apple</p><p>Apple has cooked up a new comparison webpage designed to coax iPhone owners to upgrade to the latest model. Launched earlier this week, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/why-upgrade/" >Why Upgrade page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lets you compare the key features of an iPhone 15 with those from an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 12. Partly informational, but mostly promotional, the webpage doesn’t include an iPhone 13 or an iPhone 14, clearly showing which users Apple is targeting here.</p><p>Browsing to the webpage prompts you to choose an older iPhone model from the menu on the left. You can pick an iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, or iPhone 12 Pro Max. The menu on the right limits your choices to an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max. Yep, the whole point of this webpage is to encourage you to buy from the latest lineup of iPhones. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/" >The best iPhone models you can buy right now (including the iPhone 15) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Depending on the models you pick, the webpage segues into a comparison of key features between the two phones you chose. Apple makes sure to tout the key selling points. Starting with the camera, the page boasts about the iPhone 15’s better camera resolution, beefier telephoto lens, Action mode, Cinematic mode, 4K video, and more storage for all your photos and videos.</p><p>The webpage goes on to promote the iPhone 15’s more powerful Bionic chip, longer battery life, and Dynamic Island. As for the finale, Apple tells you where and how you can upgrade from your older iPhone to the newest one, describing its Trade-In program, interest-free monthly Installment plan, carrier deals, and live shopping experience with a specialist.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The webpage does serve as a useful aid for anyone thinking about upgrading to a newer iPhone. And I can’t fault Apple for its promotional tactics. With the smartphone market saturated, fewer new users are buying smartphones for the first time. That means companies like Apple need to coax people with older phone models to upgrade.</p><p>Still, I wish the webpage included the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 lineup for a full comparison (which would, of course, mean listing fewer reasons to upgrade to an iPhone 15). There’s also no way to compare models within the iPhone 15 lineup, say an iPhone 15 with an iPhone 15 Pro.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-14-pro/" >iPhone 15 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: Which model should you upgrade to? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For that, you can use Apple’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/" >standard iPhone comparison page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is actually more helpful than the new webpage. Here, you’re able to compare three different models from any lineup, including the iPhone 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, X, 8, 7, 6, and SE.</p><p>To get a more comprehensive (and more objective) comparison of different iPhones, check out the following ZDNET stories: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-iphone-15-models-compared-iphone-15-vs-plus-vs-pro-vs-pro-max/" >iPhone 15 vs. Plus vs. Pro vs. Pro Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-14-pro/" >iPhone 15 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-13-pro-should-you-upgrade-to-the-newest-model/" >iPhone 15 Pro vs iPhone 13 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-im-recommending-the-standard-iphone-16-over-the-pro-this-year-and-im-not-alone/"  title="Why I&#39;m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I&#39;m not alone)">Why I’m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-onedrive-messing-with-your-files-how-to-get-your-windows-storage-under-control/"  title="Is OneDrive messing with your files?

Instead of being scattered across Apple’s websites, everything you need is now on Apple’s <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/docs" >new Documentation page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Spotted by <a class="link"   href="https://www.macotakara.jp/etc/support/entry-46403.html" >Japanese blog MacOtakara <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the Documentation page has groups for all of Apple’s products: Mac, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Vision Pro, AirPods, Apple TV, HomePod, iPod, Displays, Accessories, and Software.</p><p>“Apple has opened a ‘Documentation’ site that summarizes manuals, specifications, and downloads,” according to a Google translation of MacOtakara’s story. “Downloads, manuals, and technical specifications that were previously available as support resources are now organized by product category.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ive-been-using-the-same-99-airpods-for-five-years-heres-how-i-made-them-last/" >I’ve been using the same $99 AirPods for five years - how I made them last <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If you select a category for a hardware product, you’ll see its various models. Choosing a specific one will give you links to technical specs, a user guide, an info sheet, and in some cases, a repair manual.</p><p>Additionally, you can search for manuals and other info by product name and other criteria. From the search results, you can also access documentation, support articles, and posts on Apple’s community forums.</p><p>For example, I was able to easily find a repair manual for my iPhone 14 Pro. The manual included photos of the phone’s internal layout and parts, told me what tools and part numbers I needed to order for certain repairs, showed me how to run diagnostic tests, and explained how to investigate specific issues that might come up.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Beyond accessing manuals and guides for all the core Apple products, you’ll find information on accessories, including Apple keyboards, mice, printers, and AirTags. The Software category provides details on applications like iTunes, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, and Final Cut. Selecting an application takes you to a page where you can download the software.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/7-ipad-pro-features-that-would-make-me-instantly-upgrade-to-apples-next-model/" >7 iPad Pro features that would make me instantly upgrade to Apple’s next model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple’s new Documentation page is another step forward in the company finally embracing the right-to-repair movement. In August 2023, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/apple-does-a-180-and-endorses-californias-right-to-repair-law/" >Apple came out in favor of a right-to-repair bill <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> passed in California that strengthened the rights of Californians to repair their own electronic devices and appliances. The bill also required companies to offer the necessary parts, tools, and diagnostic services for consumers and third-party repair shops.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-im-recommending-the-standard-iphone-16-over-the-pro-this-year-and-im-not-alone/"  title="Why I&#39;m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I&#39;m not alone)">Why I’m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-onedrive-messing-with-your-files-how-to-get-your-windows-storage-under-control/"  title="Is OneDrive messing with your files?

The virtual assistant has a new look and a new list of features for users. The Siri logo has been redesigned, and instead of seeing the Siri bubble when users talk to it, a new glowing, colorful light that wraps around the device’s edges will illuminate the display. </p><p>Looks aside, Siri will now understand and respond more naturally, making interactions feel more human-like. The AI assistant will also be able to maintain context from one request to the next to answer follow-up questions accurately. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-get-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/" >Every iPhone model that will get Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones won’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>With context on what is on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac and screen awareness, Siri can also make inferences from things you’ve gotten in your email, photos in your library, or messages. Apple shared an example of Siri being capable of adding an address to a contact card after a friend shared it in a text message. </p><p>The voice assistant will also be able to perform hundreds of new actions across Apple and third-party apps, like opening articles from a Reading List or looking up a specific photo in your library. </p><p>Apple is also upgrading Siri to understand text, allowing users to type or speak to Siri as needed. </p><h2 id="What’s-new-in-Apple’s-photo-editing-search"><a href="#What’s-new-in-Apple’s-photo-editing-search" class="headerlink" title="What’s new in Apple’s photo editing &amp; search?"></a>What’s new in Apple’s photo editing &amp; search?</h2><p>Apple</p><p>Like the Google Pixel’s Magic Eraser, Apple is giving its devices a new, AI-powered photo editing feature called Clean Up.

This partnership brings ChatGPT integrations with Siri and the systemwide Writing Tools. </p><p>When users make a Siri request that the voice assistant determines would be better handled by ChatGPT, the virtual assistant asks them if it’s okay to share their prompt with the AI chatbot. Then, it shows the ChatGPT response in the same window. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-finally-gave-us-the-ipad-app-weve-waited-14-years-for-at-wwdc-2024/" >Apple finally gave us the iPad app we’ve waited 14 years for at WWDC 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple says its ChatGPT integration has privacy protections in place, with obscured IP addresses and no request storage by OpenAI.

However, Apple Intelligence is expected to rely on the cloud for at least some tasks, though the company is prioritizing on-device processing for enhanced privacy. Whether a specific task will be processed on-device or in the cloud will depend on task complexity, resource availability, data privacy considerations, and latency requirements. </p><p>Essentially, if a task is simple enough to be processed locally, leveraging the device’s processing power and battery life, and requires immediate results, it is more likely to be handled on-device. Tasks involving sensitive data could also prioritize on-device processing, as Apple prioritizes data privacy.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-are-apples-ai-features-not-coming-to-lower-end-iphones-heres-my-guess-as-an-it-expert/" >Why are Apple’s AI features not coming to lower-end iPhones? Here’s my guess as an IT expert <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In turn, cloud-based AI processing requires sending data from the device to remote servers that can handle complex or computationally heavy tasks. In Apple’s case, tasks requiring processing large amounts of data or updated models could include intricate analysis and advanced <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" >generative AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> requests. </p><p>Apple is leveraging what it calls Private Cloud Compute for complex tasks that require cloud servers. These processes draw on larger server-based models while protecting user privacy. The servers are built on Apple Silicon, and the data is never saved in the cloud.</p><p>Depending on its complexity and system requirements, an algorithm will determine whether a task requiring AI should be processed on-device or offloaded to the cloud. Simpler tasks like a Siri request and other basic NLP tasks can be processed on-device. More complex tasks, like generating a detailed summary of a large document, will be sent to the cloud, where more robust processing can occur. </p><h2 id="Is-Apple-Intelligence-actually-private-and-secure"><a href="#Is-Apple-Intelligence-actually-private-and-secure" class="headerlink" title="Is Apple Intelligence actually private and secure?"></a>Is Apple Intelligence actually private and secure?</h2><p>Apple</p><p>“Apple Intelligence has groundbreaking privacy protection,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering, during the WWDC 2024 keynote. Apple strongly emphasized consumer privacy when it announced Apple Intelligence, with Federighi saying its “architecture is built with privacy at the core.”</p><p>The company is striving to keep the AI features secure through several mechanisms. including:</p><ul><li><strong>On-device processing:</strong> Local computation processes ensure that sensitive and private information remains under the user’s control. The tasks are processed directly on the device, which requires strong computational power. That is why Apple requires its AI features to run on A17 Pro, M1, and newer processors.</li><li><strong>“Private cloud compute,” or secure cloud processing:</strong> Apple uses secure, dedicated Apple silicon servers to handle complex tasks that can’t be processed on the device. It also uses cryptographic verification, letting only servers whose software has been publicly logged for inspection communicate with Apple devices.</li><li><strong>Limited data sharing and no retention:</strong> Apple is ensuring consumers that when data needs to be sent to cloud servers, only the necessary information is sent, reducing exposure. It also says this data is not retained, further protecting consumer privacy.</li><li><strong>Independent code review:</strong> With Private Cloud Compute, Apple explained that the code is available for independent experts to inspect and verify it meets privacy standards.</li><li><strong>Data encryption:</strong> Apple encrypts all data sent to and from its servers as another layer of security.</li><li><strong>Ability to opt out:</strong> Perhaps most importantly, users can opt-in for Apple Intelligence features, which will be introduced as beta versions as Apple works to improve its AI capabilities over time.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMEJvwMM0vk?si=EQF_jo_4u9v5iJ_C" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-the-technical-requirements-for-Apple-Intelligence"><a href="#What-are-the-technical-requirements-for-Apple-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="What are the technical requirements for Apple Intelligence?"></a>What are the technical requirements for Apple Intelligence?</h2><p>Apple</p><p>Apple’s new AI features will be compatible with the latest Apple devices, including iPhone 15 Pro or newer models, which run on an A17 Pro chip, and iPads and Macs with an M1 chip or newer. </p><p>While these AI features may help drive sales of new iPhones and Macs, as a current iPhone 14 Pro Max owner, I hope that at least some will trickle down to older iPhone models. </p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-im-recommending-the-standard-iphone-16-over-the-pro-this-year-and-im-not-alone/"  title="Why I&#39;m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I&#39;m not alone)">Why I’m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-onedrive-messing-with-your-files-how-to-get-your-windows-storage-under-control/"  title="Is OneDrive messing with your files?

All the artificial intelligence (AI) features Apple unveiled may be very tempting, but is the iPhone 16 enough of an upgrade to warrant a new $1,000+ payment?</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/preorder-the-iphone-16-now-and-even-get-one-for-free-heres-how/" >Preorder the iPhone 16 now (and even get one for free) - here’s how <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>As an iPhone 14 Pro Max user, I’m not convinced that the new AI-enabled <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 16 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is worth the upgrade. However, the USB-C charging, the action button, or new camera features may make the upgrade worthwhile. If you’re trying to decide, read on to learn why you should upgrade or why it may be worth holding off until the iPhone 17.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Features</strong></th><th><strong>iPhone 16 Pro</strong></th><th><strong>iPhone 14 Pro</strong></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Starting price</strong></td><td>$999</td><td>$800</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Display</strong></td><td>6.3-in Super Retina XDR OLED</td><td>6.1-in Super Retina XDR OLED</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>199 g (7 oz)</td><td>206 g (7.3 oz)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Apple A18 Pro</td><td>Apple A16</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>8 GB</td><td>6GB</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</td><td>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Battery</strong></td><td>3,355 mAh</td><td>3,200 mAh</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Camera</strong></td><td>48MP Wide | 12MP Tele</td><td>48MP UW</td><td>12MP Selfie</td><td>48MP Wide | 12MP Tele</td><td>12MP UW</td><td>12MP Selfie</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eu4vwlZcMvM?si=4vEczfVU4BUUFP-t" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-iPhone-16-Pro-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-iPhone-16-Pro-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the iPhone 16 Pro if…"></a>You should buy the iPhone 16 Pro if…</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><h3 id="1-You-want-Apple-Intelligence"><a href="#1-You-want-Apple-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="1. You want Apple Intelligence"></a>1. You want Apple Intelligence</h3><p>Apple’s artificial intelligence push, aptly named Apple Intelligence, will be available over the coming months on the iPhone 16 lineup, but it’s not coming to the iPhone 14 Pro. Though the iPhone 14 Pro will get iOS 18, it’ll soon be short on AI features, rendering it outdated. If you’d like to stay up-to-date with the latest AI features or already use other AI tools in your day-to-day life, the iPhone 16 Pro is likely a worthy upgrade.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-hands-on/" >iPhone 16 Pro hands-on: My 3 favorite things about this ridiculously overpowered supercomputer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>To run smoothly, the Apple Intelligence features require an A17 chip or newer and at least 8GB of RAM, but the iPhone 14 Pro has the A16 chip and only 6GB of RAM. The iPhone 16 Pro features an A18 Pro chip and 8GB of RAM, making it a good device to run Apple’s AI features. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq2r4ZKM-Po?si=fA2DdEB1op-atCkz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-You’d-like-to-get-your-hands-on-the-bigger-screen"><a href="#2-You’d-like-to-get-your-hands-on-the-bigger-screen" class="headerlink" title="2. You’d like to get your hands on the bigger screen"></a>2. You’d like to get your hands on the bigger screen</h3><p>Apple has thinned out the iPhone 16 Pro’s bezels to the bare minimum and stretched the Pro models’ displays to 6.3 and 6.9 inches for the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, respectively. This gives users more screen real estate to watch videos, play games, view and edit documents, and read shared screens on video conferences.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-compared-which-iphone-should-you-buy-today/" >Every iPhone 16 model compared: Which iPhone should you buy today? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The larger smartphone also means that the iPhone 16 Pro has a larger battery than the 14 Pro, at 3,355 mAh compared to 3,200 mAh. But even without the welcome battery upgrade, the new Pro models support faster charging than ever. The iPhone 16 Pro supports 40W wired charging and 20W of MagSafe charging, so if you find the iPhone 14 Pro’s charging slow, it could be time to upgrade.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tkpBmccvJ_Q?si=J7ellPL1G1l8Axi_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-You-love-taking-beautiful-photos"><a href="#3-You-love-taking-beautiful-photos" class="headerlink" title="3. You love taking beautiful photos"></a>3. You love taking beautiful photos</h3><p>The iPhone 16 Pro features some of the best camera enhancements, including the improved ultrawide camera. The UW camera moved to align with a larger, improved Sony sensor, so it’s going from a measly 12MP to 48MP. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-demoed-apples-standard-iphone-16-and-didnt-envy-the-pro-models-at-all/" >I demoed Apple’s standard iPhone 16 and didn’t envy the Pro models at all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If you love taking photos with your smartphone, the camera upgrades alone may be enough to upgrade to an iPhone 16 Pro. The optical zoom is now 5x, an upgrade from the iPhone 14 Pro’s 3x zoom. The iPhone 16 Pro will also feature Apple’s new capture button, which lets you control the camera with gestures, like moving your finger and tapping the touch-enabled button. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Pre-order the iPhone 16 Pro View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8U3ooyFiAB4?si=yXPQrDhMBEJwN2EZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-should-buy-or-keep-the-iPhone-14-Pro-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-or-keep-the-iPhone-14-Pro-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy (or keep) the iPhone 14 Pro if…"></a>You should buy (or keep) the iPhone 14 Pro if…</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><h3 id="1-You’d-rather-wait-for-bigger-upgrades"><a href="#1-You’d-rather-wait-for-bigger-upgrades" class="headerlink" title="1. You’d rather wait for bigger upgrades"></a>1. You’d rather wait for bigger upgrades</h3><p>Even with the Apple Intelligence features, the iPhone 16 seems to be an incremental design change rather than a revamp; the design and functionality aren’t a radical departure from the iPhone 14 Pro. If you’re content with the look, feel, and performance of your iPhone 14, getting the iPhone 16 Pro likely won’t feel like a huge upgrade, especially since many of the AI features will come months after you get the device.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-pro-packs-a-lot-more-innovation-for-the-same-price-as-last-year/" >iPhone 14 Pro review: More innovation for the same price as the iPhone 13 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/12/iphone-16-new-features-worth-the-wait/" >Rumors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suggest the iPhone 17 may feature more dramatic design and functionality updates, making it a worthwhile jump. Besides, upgrading after two generations can be costly, which brings me to my next point. </p><h3 id="2-You-just-finished-paying-it-off"><a href="#2-You-just-finished-paying-it-off" class="headerlink" title="2. You just finished paying it off"></a>2. You just finished paying it off</h3><p>One of the biggest reasons to hold off on an upgrade is financial. The iPhone 14 Pro started at $900 at launch, which isn’t pocket change. Most buyers choose a 12-, 18-, or 24-month financing option through a carrier or Apple on a new iPhone. If you’re one of them and just finished paying off your iPhone 14 Pro and feel like you’re not financially ready to commit to another payment plan, it may be worth passing on the new iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-just-gave-me-a-compelling-reason-to-buy-the-smaller-iphone-16-pro-over-the-max-this-year/" >Apple just gave me a compelling reason to buy the smaller iPhone 16 Pro over the Max this year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>As an iPhone 14 Pro Max user, I’m still pretty happy with how my iPhone performs, its battery life, and charging time. While USB-C charging would be convenient, I don’t see myself springing for the new iPhone 16 Pro, though I may go for the iPhone 17 when it’s launched.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BN95FRW9?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C4691f0ff-b619-40d5-ba5e-5f03bf587b66%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >iPhone 14 Pro (Pre-owned) $627.45 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d-COuhPT5mk?si=wLZU6jkkAdJuAn6h" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Alternatives-to-consider"><a href="#Alternatives-to-consider" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to consider"></a>Alternatives to consider</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-15-pro-128gb-natural-titanium-verizon/6525473.p?skuId=6525473&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >BEST iPHONE ALTERNATIVE iPhone 15 Pro While the iPhone 15 Pro is a year old, it will also support Apple Intelligence and starts at $900.

When it’s folded up, the pen rests against the Pro 8’s bottom bezel. It wirelessly charges the pen, so it’s constantly ready for use. </p><p>Overall, I love the design of the Pro 8. I’ve actually found myself using it as a tablet more than I do the iPad Pro simply because the kickstand is built into the housing. There isn’t another cover or case I have to manage. It’s fantastic. </p><h2 id="But-can-it-replace-an-iPad-Pro"><a href="#But-can-it-replace-an-iPad-Pro" class="headerlink" title="But can it replace an iPad Pro?"></a>But can it replace an iPad Pro?</h2><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>Inside the Surface Pro 8 I’ve been testing is an 11th Generation Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of memory, and a 256GB SSD.

I’ve been able to notice a difference while scrolling or doing some casual gaming, but overall, I’m not sure it’s entirely needed on the Pro 8. Yes, it helps, but it also comes at a cost of battery life. </p><p>I’ve yet to get anywhere near the 14-hour estimate, even when only using the Pro 8 on Wi-Fi. However, the Pro 8’s battery has lasted as long as my iPad Pro’s battery, which is typically an 8-hour workday, give or take an hour. </p><p>One thing that surprised me after using the Pro X and iPad Pro and switching to the Pro 8 is the fact the Pro 8 still has a fan in it. I’m guessing the Pro 8 is so much thicker than the Pro X in order to make room for a cooling system. The fan isn’t terribly loud, but it does run a lot, especially when I have the Pro 8 connected to an external monitor. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>Speaking of which, I had the Pro 8 connected to a monitor for the majority of my testing. Thanks to the addition of Thunderbolt 4 support, I was able to use any of the Thunderbolt 4 ports I have on hand – including <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Thunderbolt-Display-Compatible-Delivery/dp/B09MG5GJQL/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C43f6bfac-c51b-41c3-b15b-dc9ce6532a25%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Belkin’s Pro Thunderbolt 4 Dock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has enough ports for my use. </p><p>The ability to connect a tablet to an external display and have it actually work how it’s supposed to is a huge boost for my productivity. I was able to have apps like Slack and iCloud email open on the Pro 8’s screen, while writing in iA Writer on the larger external monitor with multiple Edge tabs open. </p><p>When working on my iPad Pro connected to a monitor, whatever’s on the iPad’s screen is mirrored on the larger display. There are some apps that use Apple’s rudimentary API for external displays, but it’s not great. </p><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends-2"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends-2" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/" >The best iPads: Which model should you buy? Apple’s tablet lineup has a wide range of prices and capabilities.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Also, I have a lot of workarounds for completing certain tasks on the iPad. For instance, in order to publish content , I often have to remotely access my MacBook Pro and use Chrome in order to add images to a story, otherwise the content management system errors out. To be fair, that’s a Safari issue that also exists on the Mac. However, I can use the true version of Chrome on a Mac and not a skinned version of the WebKit rendering engine that Apple forces developers to use on the iPhone and iPad. That means Edge, Chrome, Brave, and the like are essentially all just skinned versions of Safari. </p><p>I realize that the Pro 8 is running a full-fledged operating system in Windows 11, whereas the iPad Pro is running a mobile-first operating system in iPadOS, but the devices are relatively the same size and target the same type of user. Even the prices are close enough that the comparison is warranted. </p><p>The total cost of the Surface Pro 8 with LTE, along with the Signature Keyboard Cover with Slim Pen is $2,128. The iPad Pro with 5G, 16GB of memory, 1TB of storage, Apple’s Magic Keyboard with trackpad and an Apple Pencil is $2,449. </p><h2 id="There-are-still-many-things-the-iPad-Pro-does-better"><a href="#There-are-still-many-things-the-iPad-Pro-does-better" class="headerlink" title="There are still many things the iPad Pro does better"></a>There are still many things the iPad Pro does better</h2><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>I admit, up until this point I’ve been writing what amounts to a love letter to the Surface Pro 8. But that’s because it truly deserves it. It’s a fantastic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-2-in-1-laptop/" >2-in-1 device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that I have thoroughly enjoyed using, but there are some areas where the iPad Pro is just a better device for me. </p><p>I prefer to use Apple’s Mail app along with my iCloud+ personal domain as opposed to either Thunderbird or the iCloud website for accessing my email. I also <em>love</em> writing on the iPad because there are far fewer distractions with a single app open and visible. I need to experiment more with using Windows apps in full screen and Focus assist to recreate a similar experience on Windows. It’s also a better tablet thanks to an interface that’s designed for touch-first. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/want-a-touchscreen-macbook-this-portable-monitor-makes-it-possible/"><strong>Want a touchscreen MacBook? This portable monitor makes it possible</strong></a></p><p>Another thing I love about my iPad Pro is that its performance is reliable and consistent. When using the Pro 8 with multiple apps open, there would be a slight delay or pause before an app would appear after being minimized at times. It wasn’t specific to any one app; I frequently experienced it with Thunderbird, Discord, and Slack. </p><h2 id="Bottom-line"><a href="#Bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom line"></a>Bottom line</h2><p>After a few months of the Surface Pro 8 sitting on a shelf, I have gone back to using it as my main device. I’m once again enjoying using multiple windows for multitasking, not having to worry about any extra workarounds, and I still have complete and total portability.</p><p>So, iPad or Surface Pro 8? With so much uncertainty over the future of iPadOS, I’m no longer as confident as I was once about the future of Apple’s high-end tablets. That said, Apple continues to make the best tablet-specific devices you can buy. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipados-16-1-stage-manager-multitasking-basics-how-to-use-the-new-ipad-feature/"><strong>iPadOS 16.1 Stage Manager multitasking basics</strong></a></p><p>If you’re on the fence about whether to go with the Surface Pro 8 or an iPad Pro, I’ll say this: you can’t go wrong with either device, as long as you know what you’re getting yourself into.

That’s down from the 28% that the iPhone 13 logged in 2022 when it was the best-selling phone. The biggest reason for that, Counterpoint Research says, is that the iPhone 14 was fairly similar to the iPhone 13, leading people to adopt Pro models instead in order to gain new features. </p><ol><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-14&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-14-pro-128gb-space-black-verizon/6487386.p?skuId=6487386&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >iPhone 14 Pro Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-14-pro-128gb-space-black-verizon/6487386.p?skuId=6487386&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >iPhone 14 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-13&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 Pro Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/iphone-15/&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/galaxy-a/galaxy-a14-5g-64gb-unlocked-sm-a146uzkdxaa/&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >Galaxy A14 5G <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-SM-A042M-DS-Unlocked-International/dp/B0BLZPQ5QG?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cfe78843d-83e5-4331-9a37-95e1ab510e61%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Galaxy A04e <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-A14-Unlocked-Worldwide-T-Mobile/dp/B0BXVKVR98?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cfe78843d-83e5-4331-9a37-95e1ab510e61%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Galaxy a14 4G <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li></ol><p>The 14 Pro Max and then the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-review/" >14 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> claimed the second and third spots, bolstered by customers who were looking for a new phone, but wanting enough of a difference from the previous generation.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>2021’s iPhone 13 still held strong in the number spot overall, which research shows is largely due to carrier promotions in Japan and value-focused shoppers in India.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-plus-review/" >The 15 Pro Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 15 Pro, and 15 sit in the 5 through 7 spots, respectively, despite being available for less than a quarter of the year.</p><p>It’s not until spot number eight that another manufacturer arrives, with the Galaxy A14 finally appearing on the list, followed by the Galaxy A04e in ninth place and the Galaxya14 4G in 10th.

Further down the road, the company plans to bring Apple Intelligence to the Vision Pro. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/to-rescue-the-vision-pro-apple-must-do-these-3-things/" >To rescue the Vision Pro, Apple must do these 3 things <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>As part of Apple’s 30-minute in-store demos, the company now will let people see their own photos, videos, and panoramas in VR. This may seem like a small change, but seeing your own media on the Vision Pro makes the in-store demo more of a personal experience and could lead to more sales. It’s probably not a coincidence this is coming just ahead of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/visionos-2-brings-new-spatial-computing-experiences-to-apple-vision-pro/" >visionOS 2 release this fall <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which lets you turn a 2D photo into a spatial 3D photo.</p><p>Also, Apple is ditching the default single-strap band that many users have found uncomfortable in favor of the Dual Loop band, which is an add-on purchase. Apple will also let potential customers “Go Deeper” during an in-store demo to test office features and watch videos.</p><p>Helping customers have a better experience trying out the device can only help sell more Vision Pro headsets. From <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1aj2isv/be%5Fwarned%5Fthe%5Finstore%5Fdemo%5Fis%5Fpretty%5Flame/" >reports on Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Vision Pro demos up until now have been fairly scripted; while they do a good job of showing off the device’s capabilities, customers don’t get to explore how <em>they</em> would use the headset. Now, you’ll not only get to see your photos while testing the device, you’ll get to test out the uses that are most relevant to you.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>To book an in-store Vision Pro demo, go to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/" >Apple Store site <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and select “book a demo.” You’ll need to sign in with your Apple ID, then choose a store near you, a date, and an available time. Demos take about 30 minutes.</p><p>The new demo approach is being utilized in some stores now, but it should be in all stores by July 9.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/7-upgrades-apple-vision-pro-needs-to-succeed-in-business/" >7 upgrades Apple Vision Pro needs to succeed in business <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Also, Apple is bringing Apple Intelligence, its AI platform, to the Vision Pro. When the company <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >announced Apple Intelligence earlier this month <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at WWDC 2024, the AI was coming to Macs, iPhones, and iPads. However, Bloomberg’s Gurman says Apple is “actively working” to bring its AI to the Vision Pro too. </p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like it will arrive anytime this year.

However, since the Apple Watch is available in different variants, it can be a challenge to figure out which model is right for you, whether you are buying one for the first time or upgrading to a newer model. </p><p>While the Apple Watch started as a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-fitness-tracker/" >fitness tracker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> slightly more sophisticated than a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-fitbit/" >Fitbit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it has steadily expanded to become an expansive health monitoring device and a handy tool for fast access to information and apps. It can now check your heart rate, carry your boarding pass for a flight, identify a song that’s playing nearby, open your garage door, alert you when it’s about to rain, and guide you to breathe when you get stressed – and those are just a few examples. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/"><strong>The best smartwatches: Expert tested</strong></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-right-now"><a href="#What-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-right-now" class="headerlink" title="What is the best Apple Watch right now?"></a>What is the best Apple Watch right now?</h2><p>Based on my years of testing, my pick for the best Apple Watch overall is the <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-ultra-2-gps-cellular-49mm-titanium-case-with-orange-beige-trail-loop-medium-large-titanium/6574421.p?skuId=6574421&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >Apple Watch Ultra 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, thanks to its large screen, 24-hour battery life, and emergency siren.

However, the new Apple Watch Series 10 was just unveiled at <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-we-expect-at-apples-iphone-16-event-ai-features-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-more/" >Apple’s “It’s Glowtime” event <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on September 9 and will be available on September 20.

The most notable and useful difference between the Ultra and the other Apple Watch models is the larger, brighter, flatter screen that’s covered by a sapphire crystal face and surrounded by a titanium case to considerably increase the amount of wear and tear it can handle. It’s also IPX6 dust resistant, works underwater up to 100 meters (328 feet), and has military-grade (MIL-STD 810H) certification for ruggedness. Plus, the Ultra 2 can handle high altitudes, shocks, vibrations, and temperatures as low as 4 degrees Fahrenheit and as high as 130 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p><strong>Review: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-spent-a-week-with-the-apple-watch-ultra-2-and-heres-what-stood-out-the-most/" >Apple Watch Ultra 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>ZDNET contributing writer Matthew Miller also tried out the Apple Watch Ultra 2 when it was released last year, and said he enjoyed the watch “for its long battery life, brighter display, expanded connectivity, and new watch bands” while also being impressed by the improved mental health functionality via the Mindfulness app.</p><p>The Ultra 2 adds more exclusive features as well, including a programmable Action Button with a variety of workout and adventuring functions (it can also simply activate the flashlight), dual-frequency GPS that can overcome interference from mountains and skyscrapers, and dual integrated speakers that are much louder for taking phone calls, playing music, or interacting with Siri. </p><p>Many Amazon reviewers who have bought this watch say that it’s the best Apple Watch model they have ever used, calling out the watch’s quality and large 49mm screen with 3,000 nits of brightness in particular. Beyond that, the Ultra offers one key addition to the Apple Watch Series 9 lineup: an emergency siren (activated by holding down the Action Button), which belts out an 86-decibel sound pattern that can be heard up to 600 feet (180 meters) away. This can help if you get lost or take a fall on a hike to ward off wild animals or to scare off attackers.</p><p><strong>Apple Watch Ultra 2 tech specs</strong>: <strong>Display Size:</strong> 49mm | <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 72 hours | <strong>Storage capacity:</strong> 64GB | <strong>Features:</strong> Sturdy titanium case and sapphire crystal face, enhanced safety features including a built-in siren, dual-frequency GPS, works up to 100 meters underwater</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSTJML9X/ref=asc_df_B0CSTJML9X1727002800000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B0CSTJML9X&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cd2e37f9b-58cc-458e-89ff-31c559de5340%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/376373/633495/10014?prodsku=6574327&u=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252F-%252F6574327.p%253Fcmp%253DRMX&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Brighter screen</li><li>Full array of health sensors</li><li>Hands-free double-tap gesture</li><li>More accurate Siri commands</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Cellular connectivity costs extra</li><li>Not as durable as the Ultra 2</li></ul><h2 id="Apple-Watch-Series-9"><a href="#Apple-Watch-Series-9" class="headerlink" title="Apple Watch Series 9"></a>Apple Watch Series 9</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq2r4ZKM-Po?si=fA2DdEB1op-atCkz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-for-most-people"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-for-most-people" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch for most people"></a>Best Apple Watch for most people</h3><p>The Apple Watch Series 9 can track activity, steps, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen (lung function), wrist temperature, sleep, and environmental sound levels (to protect your hearing), all of which customers who have reviewed the watch say “make day to day living so much easier.” And it uses algorithms and machine learning to spot dangerous patterns and alert you to seek medical attention if needed. There are now <a class="link"   href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-watch-lifesaving-health-features-read-5-peoples-stories/" >many stories of people who’ve had life-saving experiences <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with health alerts from an Apple Watch. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-review/"><strong>Apple Watch Series 9</strong></a></p><p>In my hands-on testing, there are two big upgrades in the Apple Watch Series 9. The first is a 2,000 nit display that is double the brightness of last year’s S8. The second is the new S9 SiP processor, which has a 30% faster GPU and processes machine learning twice as fast. This makes everything quicker, makes the animations smoother, and enables features like the new double-tap gesture and faster and more accurate Siri commands.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-vs-apple-watch-series-8/"><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Apple Watch Series 8: Should you upgrade?</strong></a></p><p>If you want the latest health sensors and safety features, great battery life (especially if you want to do sleep tracking), and you don’t need the extreme features in the Ultra 2, then you can save a lot of money by going with the aluminum model of the Apple Watch Series 9 starting at $399. However, if you decide you want the tougher stainless steel finish (starting at $699), then I’d say skip that and go straight to the Ultra because for $100 more, you get a lot of extra features. The one exception to that might be if you have a smaller wrist.</p><p><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 tech specs: Display size:</strong> 41mm or 45mm | <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 36 hours | <strong>Storage capacity:</strong> 64GB | <strong>Features:</strong> New features include a 2x brighter display, double-tap gesture, new pink color, robust S9 processor, and all the best health sensors Apple has to offer</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-se-2nd-generation-gps-40mm-starlight-aluminum-case-with-starlight-sport-band-s-m-starlight/6340296.p?skuId=6340296&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-SE-2nd-Gen-GPS-40mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-Sport-Band-S-M-Fitness-Sleep-Tracker-Crash-Detection-Heart-Rate-Monitor/5033741510&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Family Setup for kids and older adults</li><li>Health and location tracking</li><li>Fall and crash detection</li><li>Very affordable</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Not as durable as other Apple Watch models</li><li>Cellular connection requires a monthly fee</li></ul><h2 id="Apple-Watch-SE-2nd-generation"><a href="#Apple-Watch-SE-2nd-generation" class="headerlink" title="Apple Watch SE (2nd generation)"></a>Apple Watch SE (2nd generation)</h2><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-for-kids-and-first-time-buyers"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-for-kids-and-first-time-buyers" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch for kids and first-time buyers"></a>Best Apple Watch for kids and first-time buyers</h3><p>Starting at $249, what I found amazing about the Apple Watch SE (2nd gen) is how many of the same health and safety features from the Series 8 and the Ultra it actually includes. It’s easier to talk about what’s not included in the SE – it doesn’t track blood oxygen, do ECG heart checks, or check your temperature. And while the face looks just like the Series 8, the screen is actually about 20% smaller, and it also doesn’t have an always-on display.</p><p>Still, it includes nearly everything else, and the cellular connectivity is only a $50 add-on for the SE (compared to a $100 add-on for the Series 8). Like the Ultra and the Series 8, adding a cellular connection will also cost you about $10&#x2F;month with your wireless carrier. Even if you go with the cellular version and opt for the larger 44mm Apple Watch SE over the smaller 40mm version, you’ll still only top out at $329.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-se-2022-vs-apple-watch-se-2020-should-you-upgrade/" >Apple Watch SE (2022) vs Apple Watch SE (2020): Should you upgrade? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That makes it a great smartwatch to give to someone who doesn’t have an iPhone, such as a child or an elderly family member, using <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211768" >Apple’s Family Setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With cellular connectivity, they can use the Apple Watch to make and receive phone calls, get text messages, dictate replies to texts, and connect to online info like the weather. </p><p>You can even set it up from your iPhone as long as they are in your Apple family group. If you are connecting an elderly relative who has health issues, the added health sensors in the Series 8 might make it worth the peace of mind to upgrade. Customers who have reviewed the watch also agree that it offers excellent value for the price, especially if you are new to the Apple Watch family.</p><p><strong>Apple Watch SE tech specs: Display size:</strong> 40mm or 44mm | <strong>Battery life</strong>: Up to 18 hours | <strong>Storage capacity:</strong> 32GB | <strong>Features:</strong> Most affordable Apple Watch, family setup for kids and older adults, health and location tracking, and fall and crash detection</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Green-Aluminum-Clover/dp/B09HF1DC1J?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cd2e37f9b-58cc-458e-89ff-31c559de5340%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Comes in unique blue and green colors</li><li>Good deal if you buy used or refurbished</li><li>Has most of the latest health features</li><li>Water, dust, and crack resistant</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Shorter battery life than the Series 8 or Series 9</li><li>Display isn’t as bright as the Series 9</li></ul><h2 id="Apple-Watch-Series-7"><a href="#Apple-Watch-Series-7" class="headerlink" title="Apple Watch Series 7"></a>Apple Watch Series 7</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LlVkEwpjKKo?si=hXi-mchMaJvbnIzM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-for-unique-colors"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-for-unique-colors" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch for unique colors"></a>Best Apple Watch for unique colors</h3><p>When it first launched in fall 2021, the Apple Watch Series 7 brought key upgrades including a 20% larger screen, fast charging (0% to 80% in 45 minutes with a USB-C cable), a more durable face that’s made out of crystal and is 50% thicker than the previous model, and IPX6 dust resistance. Those are features that still aren’t available on the Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-7-review/" >Apple Watch Series 7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>With the SE now holding down the entry-level Apple Watch market, it’s best to think about buying the Series 7 in comparison to the SE. If you just want a low-cost entry into the Apple Watch ecosystem and an easy purchase, then you can buy a new SE and quickly get started. A new Apple Watch Series 7 costs nearly the same price as the Series 8, so it’s much better to get the Series 8. However, you can find a refurbished Series 7 for $200-$250 on places like <a class="link"   href="https://www.backmarket.com/en-us/l/apple-watch/38fd0158-d500-43d2-817c-738859e3e7dd#model=999%20Apple%20Watch%20Series%207" >BackMarket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.refurb.me/refurbished/apple-watch/series-7" >RefurbMe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Amazon also sells refurbished models, and the overall reviews from customers who bought a previously owned Apple Watch Series 7 were positive, with no complaints about battery life or the condition of the watch.</p><p>There are really only a few great reasons to buy the Series 7 at this point. The first is if you want the additional health features (heart and lung tracking) for an Apple Watch you’re giving to an elderly relative or if you want the extra durability for an Apple Watch you’re giving to a kid. The other big reason to buy the Series 7 is that it comes in two really nice colors – green and blue – that Apple no longer offers for the Series 8. But again, if you’re going to get a Series 7, I’d recommend getting a refurbished one.</p><p><strong>Apple Watch Series 7 tech specs: Display size:</strong> 41mm or 45mm | <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 18 hours | <strong>Storage</strong>: 32GB | <strong>Features:</strong> Large display, fast charging, health-focused features, and more durable than the SE</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-hermes/&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>High-quality, stylish bands</li><li>Exclusive Hermès watch faces</li><li>Includes an extra Sports Band in the box</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Expensive for what you get</li><li>Same features as regular Series 9</li></ul><h2 id="Apple-Watch-Hermes"><a href="#Apple-Watch-Hermes" class="headerlink" title="Apple Watch Hermès"></a>Apple Watch Hermès</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0b9szh8vEk?si=NlGzpJ6MN_SJNk5A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-for-dressing-up"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-for-dressing-up" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch for dressing up"></a>Best Apple Watch for dressing up</h3><p>If you’re looking to splurge on a designer smartwatch, the Apple Watch Hermès is a chic option for fashionistas.

However, Hermès sells leather bands for its edition of the Apple Watch on its site.</p><p>As you might expect, the price range for this Apple Watch model will cost you a lot more for the designer brand name.

While the Ultra 2 is especially loaded with fitness and durability features for athletes and adventurers, its larger and brighter display, better battery life, and emergency siren will appeal to many others as well.</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Watch Series 9</td><td>All the latest health and fitness features at an approachable price. It tracks heart health, breathing, temperature, sleep, and, of course, activity and fitness. The Apple Watch keeps getting smarter, and this is the best-selling model.</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Watch SE</td><td>A more budget-friendly Apple Watch. This includes all the basic features at a lower price and is a great pick for first-time Apple Watch buyers or to give to a kid or an elderly family member, since you can configure it using Family Setup even if they don’t have an iPhone.</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Watch Series 7</td><td>An Apple Watch in unique blue or green colors. The Apple Watch Series 7 is for sale in many places, and you can get a refurbished model for $200 to $275. The best reason to get it is the fact that it comes in two unique colors you can’t get in the Series 9.</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Watch Hermès</td><td>An Apple Watch for dressing up as well as working out. For those who love the French luxury brand, this special edition of the Apple Watch features premium bands and exclusive watch faces for those who view their timepiece as a fashion accessory.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Factors-to-consider-when-choosing-the-best-Apple-Watch"><a href="#Factors-to-consider-when-choosing-the-best-Apple-Watch" class="headerlink" title="Factors to consider when choosing the best Apple Watch"></a>Factors to consider when choosing the best Apple Watch</h2><p>While all the Apple Watches on this list have a slew of health-tracking features and other useful apps, their differences are what you need to consider before buying one, including: </p><ul><li><strong>Display size:</strong> Apple Watch displays now come in essentially three different sizes (40&#x2F;41, 44&#x2F;45, and 49). Depending on the size of your wrist and how much you want to interact with the watch for quick actions, the display size will be a big factor in determining which model makes the most sense.</li><li><strong>Features:</strong> Apple methodically adds more and more new features to the Apple Watch each year, so we compared safety features, health sensors, band options, battery life, and other useful options.</li><li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Each Apple Watch has a number of different variations, so pricing can vary widely – especially based on which band you pick.

When we test smartwatches, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.</p><ul><li><strong>Daily wear</strong>: We wear the smartwatch as our primary watch, with communications, applications, and other elements being tested as if it were our only smartwatch.</li><li><strong>Application selection and performance</strong>: One aspect that makes smartwatches different than standard watches is the support for applications. We load up the watch with apps and then test the performance and functionality of those applications. For example, Apple particularly excels in the area of third-party application support.</li><li><strong>Workouts</strong>: Smartwatch makers have embraced health and fitness so we take smartwatches out for running with GPS, rowing on the Hydrow, biking on trails, and walking with the family. GPS and heart rate data is tracked and then we evaluate the accuracy against proven GPS sports watches.</li><li><strong>Sleep and activity tracking:</strong> Sleep tracking has improved with smartwatches over time and we evaluate and compare them to smart rings and other watches. Nighttime is also a good time to charge your smartwatch, so you may choose not to use your watch to track sleep so your watch can serve faithfully all day and into the night.</li></ul><p>For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-smartwatches-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >smartwatch testing methodology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aYH0B2HqcIM?si=3fkoG85L6hAeB4ok" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-new-in-the-Apple-Watch-10"><a href="#What-is-new-in-the-Apple-Watch-10" class="headerlink" title="What is new in the Apple Watch 10?"></a>What is new in the Apple Watch 10?</h2><p>Apple just announced the new Apple Watch Series 10 during its September event, and there are several notable features.

No longer up for sale are the iPhone 13 and the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-pro-review/" >two Pro models of the iPhone 15 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This leaves the iPhone 14, 14 Plus, 15, 15 Plus, iPhone SE, and of course, the new iPhone 16 models as your only options should you want to <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/" >buy directly from Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-vs-iphone-16-should-you-upgrade-to-apples-latest-model/"><strong>iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 16: Should you upgrade to Apple’s latest model?</strong></a></p><p>The retirement of the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max comes as no great surprise. When Apple launched the iPhone 15 series last year, it also jettisoned the Pro models of the iPhone 14. Retiring only the Pro flavors of the previous year’s phone is an attempt by Apple to push buyers who want a Pro version to grab the latest model. That’s as true this year as it was last year.</p><p>But, the exit of the iPhone 13 marks a significant milestone for Apple’s phone lineup. The iPhone 13 was the last model to include a physical SIM. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-drops-the-sim-card-slot-heres-what-that-means/" >iPhone 14 and its predecessors are eSIM-only phones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. For me, that’s perfectly fine. I’m not a huge fan of physical SIMs.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Having to pop open the tray and then juggle that tiny card is something I can do without. Plus, switching among eSIMs when traveling to another country is a pleasure compared to swapping different physical SIMs. But I’m sure many iPhone users prefer the old-style SIMs, especially since not all countries or carriers yet support eSIMs.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/esim-vs-sim-whats-the-difference/" >eSIM vs. SIM: What’s the difference? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The iPhone 13 was also the last model to come in a mini version. Designed as an alternative to big phones, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-13-mini-lives-the-case-for-buying-it-in-2022/" >iPhone 13 mini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> sported a svelte 5.4-inch screen, ideal for people who prefer their iPhones in a small size, and with a lower price tag. Now, Apple’s only small-screened option is the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-iphone-se-2022-review/" >iPhone SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with its 4.7-inch display.</p><p>The exit of the iPhone 13, iPhone 15 Pro, and Pro Max puts potential buyers in a quandary. What should you buy if you need a new iPhone and also want it directly from Apple?</p><p>If you crave a smaller phone and budget price, the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-se&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is still a viable choice. However, with the current third-generation model launched in 2022, Apple may unveil the fourth-generation version next year. So you may want to wait to see if that product materializes.</p><p>If your budget is higher and you don’t mind an older model without the Pro features – the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-14&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would be solid choices. But keep in mind the lure of the latest features. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-delivers-on-hardware-upgrades-but-punts-apple-intelligence-rollout/" >Apple Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, for example, will be available only throughout the iPhone 16 lineup, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. If you want the new AI-powered tricks, especially the improvements headed for Siri, then one of the four iPhone 16 models is your only choice.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/"><strong>The 5 best iPhone 16 Pro features that enthusiasts will care about</strong></a></p><p>Typically, I’ve always gravitated toward the Pro models for their better displays, beefier cameras, and faster CPUs. Yet this year, the differences between the regular iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Pro&#x2F;Pro Max are less significant than in previous years. The Pro and Pro Max boast larger screen sizes and slightly better camera features, but that’s about it. So if you want the latest model but don’t want to overspend, an <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would be the way go to.</p><p>Of course, although Apple has discontinued the iPhone 13 and iPhone 15 Pro models, they’re all still readily available elsewhere. You can easily find them through third-party retailers such as Amazon, eBay, Gazelle, and other sites that sell used phones.</p><p>A few months ago, I bought a used <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-13-128GB-Midnight/dp/B09LNW3CY2/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C6f8ad8a7-600a-449a-a116-ef55e24e57d0%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >iPhone 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> through Amazon, which I use for testing and which has performed without a hitch.

From the moment you pick up the ultra-thin slab of glass and aluminum to when you discover finer details in darker scenes thanks to the Tandem OLED display, such burdenless design choices make Apple’s premium iPad model a justifiable option for those willing to spend the money.</p><p>With configurations ranging from $999 to $2,599, keep in mind that the higher storage tiers (1TB and 2TB) also come with double the RAM (16GB vs. 8GB) and an extra CPU core. It’s a subtle, under-the-hood difference that’s easy to miss, especially when cross-shopping <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/" >between iPad models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. If you can use the greater compute, have an offline-heavy workflow, and&#x2F;or want the most future-proofed iPad on the market, it’s worth the upcharge. Otherwise, the base 11- or 13-inch model will serve you just fine, as they have for me.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OZQJUTr44rA?si=ADA0nD1VnXjR_sH0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Display</th><th>11-inch or 13-inch OLED with ProMotion (10Hz to 120Hz)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Weight</td><td>444 grams or 579 grams</td></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Apple Silicon M4 with up to 16GB of RAM</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>Starting at 256GB, up to 2TB</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>Up to 10 hours of surfing the web</td></tr><tr><td>Camera</td><td>12MP wide (4K, ProRes), Landscape 12MP ultra-wide</td></tr><tr><td>Accessories</td><td>Magic Keyboard, Apple Pencil Pro&#x2F;USB-C</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Landscape/dp/B0D3J9XDMQ?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cfbf10d9a-7cb8-49d5-8606-c235946e0be8%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Starting at $999 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr></tbody></table><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nGlyEL5K6Y?si=3KZhTTBvKcPmyS68" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-I-tested-the-iPad-Pro-2024"><a href="#How-I-tested-the-iPad-Pro-2024" class="headerlink" title="How I tested the iPad Pro (2024)"></a>How I tested the iPad Pro (2024)</h2><p>Over the past week and a half, I’ve used (or attempted to use) the 11-inch iPad Pro as my primary computer for work and as a secondary, entertainment-only device. When it wasn’t paired to a Wi-Fi connection 90% of the time, it ran off my phone’s T-Mobile hotspot. While Apple sells an <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Landscape/dp/B0D3J9XDMQ?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cfbf10d9a-7cb8-49d5-8606-c235946e0be8%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >LTE version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of the iPad Pro, my primary testing grounds for the device have been at home, a local café, and my work office – nowhere adventurous enough to justify the always-connected upgrade.</p><p>I also paired the iPad with Apple’s revamped <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWR03LL/A/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-11%25E2%2580%2591inch-m4-us-english-white&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Magic Keyboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The $299 starting price gave me pause when I first checked out the accessory, but the thinner, lighter aluminum form factor, larger trackpad, and a new row of function keys this year make the keyboard case more essential than ever for the full iPad experience.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-best-features-of-the-iPad-Pro-2024"><a href="#What-are-the-best-features-of-the-iPad-Pro-2024" class="headerlink" title="What are the best features of the iPad Pro (2024)?"></a>What are the best features of the iPad Pro (2024)?</h2><p><strong>Not just any OLED panel</strong>: “Tandem OLED” is the term Apple uses to describe the arrangement of light panels underneath the new iPad Pro. By stacking two layers of OLED, the iPad Pro gets remarkably bright (up to 1,600 nits for HDR content) while offering the same traditional benefits of the display type, including better contrast (it’s easier to discern the lighter and darker pixels on the screen) and improved color accuracy at a per-pixel level.</p><p>The OLED display on the 11-inch model is an even bigger upgrade over its direct predecessor’s LCD display.</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>In practice, Tandem OLED makes the iPad Pro a phenomenal tablet for visual experiences. I’ve been able to complete text-heavy and photo-editing work – which often require adequate viewing angles – under a New York City sun that thinks it’s already summer. Watching Netflix and Disney+ on the iPad is straight eye candy; colors pop, and the darker, moodier scenes have a level of shadow detail unseen on older Pro models.</p><p><strong>This could pass as an iPad Pro Air:</strong> There’s an <a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/AJJ353epH3o?feature=shared&t=62" >old SNL skit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> about Apple making the iPhone too thin and light, and it immediately came to mind when I first held the new iPad Pro. While I’ve never heard someone complain about the iPad Pro being <em>too thick,</em> I don’t mind the even slimmer form factor. Both the 11-inch and 13-inch models are thin. Super thin. So thin, in fact, that it’s almost inexcusable not to pack the tablet whenever I’m traveling. Dropping the iPad when watching movies in bed also hurts a little less now.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-air-2024-review/" >I tested the 11-inch iPad Air for a week, and it made my $1,200 Android tablet feel old <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The biggest yet most subtle advantage of being nimble is how much more burdenless it feels to carry the iPad around while it’s encased in a folio or keyboard cover.</p><p>The iPad Pro (top) is about the same thickness as the top lid of the MacBook Air M3 (bottom).</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p><strong>Everyone benefits from the M4</strong>: The subtle wins carry over to the new <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-ipad-pros-new-outrageously-powerful-m4-chip-designed-for-ai-workloads/" >M4 chip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that powers the iPad Pro, from supporting the Tandem OLED’s variable refresh rate (10Hz to 120Hz) to enhancing the accuracy of Face ID, which captures from a front-facing camera situated on the longer side of the iPad now – I’ve dug that design change since testing the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-10th-gen-2022-review/" >iPad in 2022 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-vs-ipad-air-2024/" >iPad Pro (2024) vs. iPad Air (2024): Which Apple tablet is best for you? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>A more efficient processor means the iPad absolutely speeds through app load times, 4K video exports, detecting and cropping subjects out of images, and more. On a recent flight, I played 30 minutes of <em>Genshin Impact</em> at max graphics settings, 120fps and all, and the iPad got lukewarm at its worst – a major improvement over my 2022 model, which would overheat after 10 minutes.</p><p>Professionals will notice the performance gains even more, with services such as Final Cut Pro (for iPad) gaining new capabilities like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-new-final-cut-pro-for-ipad-features-are-game-changing-for-me-as-a-filmmaker/" >Live Multicam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and color grading. I’m not exactly sure how many creatives can or have already switched to an iPad-iPhone-only workflow, but it feels less challenging now than ever before. This ultimately lowers the barrier to entry for videographers, digital artists, and other content creators, which is never a bad thing.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="What-I’d-like-to-see-in-the-next-model"><a href="#What-I’d-like-to-see-in-the-next-model" class="headerlink" title="What I’d like to see in the next model"></a>What I’d like to see in the next model</h2><p><strong>More flexible software:</strong> The limitations of iPadOS remain with every generation of iPad reviewed; I can talk all day about how lovely it’d be to have native apps that give me something remotely close to their desktop counterparts or how every iPadOS update feels like another small step towards an ever-distant <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/touchscreen-macbook-4-reasons-why-we-love-the-idea-and-4-reasons-why-we-dont/" >touchscreen MacBook dream <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-m4-ipad-pros-true-potential-will-be-realized-at-wwdc-and-ai-will-have-a-lot-to-do-with-it/" >The M4 iPad Pro’s true potential will be realized at WWDC, and AI will have a lot to do with it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>iPadOS 17 still has some kinks to work out, and several missing features. For example, text sizing on Safari is inconsistent across split-screen mode, floating windows, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-stage-manager-on-your-ipad/" >Stage Manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. There are also moments when I need to import and export large files, and a compulsive swipe-out to a different app is all it takes to put those tasks on pause. In an ideal world, some memory – which the iPad Pro has plenty of – should be dedicated to keeping those processes running in the background.</p><p>Perhaps the iPad Pro doesn’t need to be as good as a Mac; it just needs to be a good iPad. </p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>I’m also aware that Apple sells iPads like no other tablet maker, generating an <em>underwhelming</em> <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/" >$5.6 billion in revenue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> last quarter. So it doesn’t surprise me that Apple continues to distance the iPad and Mac experiences to satisfy the greater portion of the two user bases, beyond the tech enthusiasts who want one device to rule them all.</p><p><strong>More ports, even if they’re not on the iPad:</strong> Adding more port options, from an extra USB-C to MicroSD&#x2F;SD to a headphone jack, may be a potential fix for professionals who want to make the most of Apple’s magical glass slab. The ability to quickly import photos and videos via an SD card and then edit them on Lightroom or Final Cut Pro&#x2F;Premiere Rush would be helpful for creatives; a 3.5mm headphone jack would solve any audio latency and quality issues that engineers and sound designers face; and an extra USB-C port would give users more flexibility to charge and connect the iPad to other devices.</p><p>Of course, slimming down the iPad Pro means Apple likely won’t move towards adding ports. Given how essential the Magic Keyboard is to the iPad, however, it could be even more so with the additional I&#x2F;O.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPAKth3O_5c?si=3YDfzJAZMDp1gFRz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-thought"><a href="#Final-thought" class="headerlink" title="Final thought"></a>Final thought</h2><p>Apple’s tablet lineup is ultimately (and has always been) confined by an operating system that promotes flexibility and ease of use over high-power multitasking.

We saw design changes, hardware updates, the implementation of Apple Intelligence, and more. The presentation was packed with reveals; both big and small. So to make things easy for you, we’re highlighting four of the best features for the iPhone 16 line.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDNwgyE0nbY?si=3k_WBhpIw3WudJot" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Apple-Intelligence"><a href="#1-Apple-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="1. Apple Intelligence"></a>1. Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Screenshot by Kayla Solino&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Siri has finally received its long-awaited update, becoming “smarter” than ever before. The AI assistant has a richer understanding of language thanks to Apple Intelligence. Siri can now maintain context even when a user makes multiple requests. Plus it can continue following along even if you stumble over your words. If you have any burning questions about any Apple products, the AI has more extensive product knowledge to help you shop.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/" >The 5 best iPhone 16 Pro features that enthusiasts will care about <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The updates don’t stop there. Apple Intelligence enables so much more. They include but are not limited to, Writing Tools to help you edit text, call recordings for the Phone app, notification summaries, and Private Cloud Compute for enhancing the device’s processing power. </p><p>Apple Intelligence will not be available at launch. It’ll roll out in October as a software upgrade in the United States and in English only. It’ll be available in more countries like the United Kingdom later this December. And in 2025, it’ll expand to other languages like Spanish.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HSFNIAYChbA?si=4TIlsUrYmY5vP2il" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Camera-Upgrades"><a href="#2-Camera-Upgrades" class="headerlink" title="2. Camera Upgrades"></a>2. Camera Upgrades</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Apple showed off so many camera updates at the event that it is impossible to talk about every single one in detail, but we’re going to try. First, the main lens on the iPhone 16 will be the new 48MP Fusion Camera. It can take wide-angle shots like previous generations. Now it sports a 2x Telephoto option for taking clear pictures from far away. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/" >The 5 best iPhone 16 Pro features that enthusiasts will care about <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Below the power button is a new tactile switch called <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/" >Camera Control <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is a special sensor allowing you to control the camera with a few light touches. A light tap instantly opens the Camera app and a few more light touches can be used to adjust the composition. You can zoom in on a subject, adjust the exposure, or change the depth of view. The best part of Camera Control is it’ll soon become accessible on third-party apps.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rBnnLFJbvr4?si=LlHYrYlOBp7NLMec" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Eye-catching-colors"><a href="#3-Eye-catching-colors" class="headerlink" title="3. Eye-catching colors"></a>3. Eye-catching colors</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Every generation of iPhones brings with it new colors. For this release, Apple decided to go bold. The shades are some of the most vibrant we’ve seen in the series, especially that bubble-gum Pink iPhone. You also have the option to go for Ultramarine Blue or muted Teal Green. Of course, you still have the classic options of Black and White. </p><p>The Pro models go for a more striking design. Desert Titanium adorns their brushed metal, making the iPhones look like they’ve been forged from bronze. If you prefer something a little more low-key, the Pro models are available in the equally impressive Black, White, and Natural Titanium too.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3AGmFrtBLHw?si=VhvpUaXHPBHl6OT6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Design-changes-bring-other-benefits"><a href="#4-Design-changes-bring-other-benefits" class="headerlink" title="4. Design changes bring other benefits"></a>4. Design changes bring other benefits</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>There’s more to the iPhone 16’s design besides color as Apple made multiple changes. We’ve already talked about the camera array and the Camera Control switch. What you may not know is the company made its mobile device tougher. It is covered in the “latest-generation Ceramic Shield”, making the iPhone 16 15% more durable than before. The glass has also been twice as tough to withstand drops.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-be-updated-to-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/" >Every iPhone model that will be updated to Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones won’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple even updated the iPhone 16’s internal design, allowing the device to dissipate heat better. This means lower internal temperatures, which results in a healthier battery. The optimization allowed for more room, too, resulting in an even larger battery. The base model can last up to 22 hours on a single charge. The Action Button makes a return, giving users quick access to various functions, from activating the Translate tool to turning on Shazam.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/"  title="20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really">20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/"  title="Want a programming job?
