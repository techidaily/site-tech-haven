TruthGPT, an AI chatbot proposed by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is generating a lot of buzz online.But what is TruthGPT? Why does Elon Musk want to create it? And how will it be different from the AI tools we already have?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600114&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Mac： Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-TruthGPT"><a href="#What-Is-TruthGPT" class="headerlink" title="What Is TruthGPT?"></a>What Is TruthGPT?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/artificial-intelligence.jpg"                      alt="Man Holding Artificial Intelligence Sticky Note"                ></p><p> TruthGPT is a proposed AI model aimed at addressing the ills of existing models that powers the likes of ChatGPT and Bard, with particular emphasis on truth and safety. According to Elon Musk, TruthGPT will be a “maximum truth-seeking” AI that understands the nature of the universe and would be unlikely to destroy humanity because it sees humans as a critical component of the universe.</p><p>Maximum truth-seeking AI? Understand the nature of the universe?</p><p> You’ll be forgiven if Musk’s description doesn’t give you a clear picture of what exactly he’s trying to build. However, you’ll get a better idea of what he’s talking about by looking at why he’s trying to build it in the first place.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17728032&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner920x120.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Is-Elon-Musk-Building-TruthGPT"><a href="#Why-Is-Elon-Musk-Building-TruthGPT" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Elon Musk Building TruthGPT?"></a>Why Is Elon Musk Building TruthGPT?</h2><p> In an interview with<a class="link"   href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/elon-musk-develop-truthgpt-warns-civilizational-destruction-ai" >Fox News <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Elon Musk expressed his concerns about how big AI firms can perpetuate bias and disinformation through AI chatbots—an emerging tool people increasingly depend on for information. Elon Musk also commented on the threat AI poses to humanity, emphasizing the possibility of an AI apocalypse, a scenario where AI systems could take control of our daily lives.</p><p> Singling out companies like OpenAI and Google, who, in his view, are not doing enough in the areas of AI safety and guarding against disinformation, Elon Musk proposed a third force—TruthGPT. The SpaceX and Tesla CEO wants to create TruthGPT as a counterweight to Google’s Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The idea is to create an AI model that tries as much as possible to be truthful in the information it provides.</p><p> Elon Musk, who recently authored an open letter calling for a<a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/why-elon-musk-want-to-pause-ai-development/" >moratorium on the development of powerful AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> models (specifically those more powerful than GPT-4), believes AI is moving too fast. He believes we need to slow down and reevaluate our approach to AI safety before AI “takes control.” TruthGPT is a large language model (LLM) that promises to address these two core concerns with today’s AI systems.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BOST%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/ost-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Would-TruthGPT-Look-Like"><a href="#What-Would-TruthGPT-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="What Would TruthGPT Look Like?"></a>What Would TruthGPT Look Like?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/mou-article-banner.jpg"                      alt="artificial brain doing data analytics "                ></p><p> The first hint into how TruthGPT would look is in the name. Considering the “GPT” appendage, TruthGPT will likely have a similar architecture to ChatGPT. Remember, Elon Musk helped assemble OpenAI and the team that built ChatGPT’s GPT model.</p><p> Also, considering GPT’s architecture has proven to be both a technical and commercial success, pursuing a different path will likely be too time-consuming and costly. Time is one thing that Elon Musk doesn’t have if he’s to build something that can truly stand toe to toe with state-of-the-art AI as soon as possible. So, don’t get too hyped—TruthGPT might not be that radically different from the AI tools we already have.</p><p> The accuracy, or in Elon Musk’s lingo, “truthfulness,” of an AI model depends heavily on its training data and the training algorithm. We are not exactly sure how TruthGPT’s training data would be sourced, but to get the best chance of building an LLM that’s as “truthful” as possible, Elon Musk’s TruthGPT would have to prioritize data from “truthful sources.” But that’s precisely the problem. Truth is a very subjective concept. What is true for me might not be true for you.</p><p>So, is this idea of a maximum truth-seeking AI even practical?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://uperfect.sjv.io/c/5597632/1246754/15155" target="_top" id="1246754"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15155-1246754"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1246754/15155"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Building-TruthGPT-Is-a-Huge-Challenge"><a href="#Why-Building-TruthGPT-Is-a-Huge-Challenge" class="headerlink" title="Why Building TruthGPT Is a Huge Challenge"></a>Why Building TruthGPT Is a Huge Challenge</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=33729450&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pexels-pixabay-159298.jpg"                      alt="Cogs on a machine"                ></p><p> Once you<a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/" >understand how large language models like GPT work <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it becomes clear that it is impractical to be correct at all times. Typically trained on a large dataset of internet data, a lot of it is, predictably, going to be false information, and LLM’s have no inert way of telling fact from fiction.</p><p> The best intervention is typically from human trainers who try to teach the language model what’s good behavior and what’s bad. But human trainers are biased.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-bias/" >Bias is passed to the AI models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , defeating the whole purpose of a “maximum truth-seeking AI.” Note, we’re not talking about outright bias or prejudice against a people or otherwise. It’s the more subtle bias about how you interpret language, situations, challenges, and so on that leach into the process. Humans are human, after all.</p><p> Of course, accuracy can also be tackled from the algorithm side. However, irrespective of the algorithm, language ambiguity still represents a big problem for the accuracy of AI models. Even humans often struggle to accurately interpret a sentence or phrase’s meaning, leading to misinformation. For AI models, ambiguity can lead to misinterpretations resulting in inaccuracies.</p><p> For Musk, TruthGPT appears to be a chance for him to carve an AI model that he sees fit to deliver the truth. How that would come about without introducing his own biases is another question entirely and effectively leads us back to the start of the conversation. How are Musk’s opinions on what is biased or not any different from those who trained and directed ChatGPT?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35408920&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro - Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-TruthGPT-an-Exciting-Possibility"><a href="#Is-TruthGPT-an-Exciting-Possibility" class="headerlink" title="Is TruthGPT an Exciting Possibility?"></a>Is TruthGPT an Exciting Possibility?</h2><p> Elon Musk’s plans for TruthGPT seem noble and commendable.

Here’s how to set it up:</p><ol><li>Install the VoiceGPT app from the Android Play Store.</li><li>Open the VoiceGPT app and log in to your ChatGPT account (using your ChatGPT credentials).</li><li>Tap on the microphone icon at the bottom of the app screen and grant the VoiceGPT app permission to access your device’s microphone when prompted.</li><li>Tap on the Home icon and scroll down to enable the<strong>Show InstaBubble</strong> setting. Also, enable the<strong>Hey, Chat</strong> hot word detection slider.</li><li>Whenever you want to use voice commands on ChatGPT, simply launch the app, tab the message icon below the screen, speak your questions and commands out loud. ChatGPT will display the text and respond by voice.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_2023-09-26-14-05-10-704_gpt-voice-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="VoiceGPT splash screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4559731&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.neowise.com/images/nd-ss-w200.jpg"                      border="0"                >NeoDownloader - Fast and fully automatic image&#x2F;video&#x2F;music downloader. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_2023-09-26-16-54-32-766_gpt-voice-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="Signing into the VoiceGPT app"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_2023-09-26-16-50-04-643_gpt-voice-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="Signing into the VoiceGPT app"                ></p><p>Close</p><p>​​​​​​​</p><p> On the settings page, it’s a good idea to enable<strong>Auto Reactivate Microphone,</strong> so you don’t have to manually re-enable the mic each time. With VoiceGPT, you can converse naturally with ChatGPT just as you would in a Google Assistant kind of conversation, probably better.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2024483/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gpt.voice.chatgpt" >VoiceGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, subscription available)</p><h2 id="3-Using-Your-Mobile-Keyboard"><a href="#3-Using-Your-Mobile-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="3.

Whether dictating an email on the Gmail website or speaking out prompts on the ChatGPT website, Voice In can come in handy. There are dozens of languages on offer, and it transcribes text with impressive speed.</p><h3 id="VoiceWave-ChatGPT-Voice-Control"><a href="#VoiceWave-ChatGPT-Voice-Control" class="headerlink" title="VoiceWave - ChatGPT Voice Control"></a><a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/voicewave-chatgpt-voice-c/baahncfnjojaofhdmdfkpeadigoemkif" >VoiceWave - ChatGPT Voice Control <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/voice-wave-chrome-extension-for-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="voice wave chrome extension for chatGPT"                ></p><p> VoiceWave is purpose-built for ChatGPT and comes with many customization features you’ll find handy. For example, you can issue voice commands in dozens of languages, and VoiceWave will automatically transcribe them to text right inside the ChatGPT prompt input box.</p><p> Recording with the tool is quite easy. Once you’ve installed and activated the Chrome extension, a small microphone icon sits next to your ChatGPT prompt input box every time you visit the ChatGPT website. Clicking the microphone icon activates the speech-to-text feature, activates your computer’s microphone, and listens to your voice commands for transcription.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Talk-to-ChatGPT"><a href="#Talk-to-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Talk-to-ChatGPT"></a><a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/talk-to-chatgpt/hodadfhfagpiemkeoliaelelfbboamlk" >Talk-to-ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467"                      border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/talk-to-chatgpt-chrome-extension.jpg"                      alt="talk-to-chatgpt chrome extension"                ></p><p> Although not entirely the best in design and accessibility, Talk-to-ChatGPT is one of the most widely used extensions for issuing voice commands to ChatGPT. It supports most major languages and comes with many customization features you’ll find useful.</p><p> Once installed and activated, the Talk-to-ChatGPT Chrome extension adds a small rectangular box in the top right corner of your screen. The box contains controls for toggling on and off voice typing.

Once installed and activated, the Chrome extension adds several buttons just below the ChatGPT prompt text box, which you can use to control your voice interaction with ChatGPT.</p><p> Unlike Talk-to-ChatGPT and VoiceWave, editing out mistakes or mistranscribed words is a bit complex since the text is not directly injected into ChatGPT’s prompt text box. It takes a bit of getting used to, but it’s an excellent speech-to-text tool nonetheless.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-ChatGPT-Get-An-Official-Audio-Input-Feature"><a href="#Will-ChatGPT-Get-An-Official-Audio-Input-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Will ChatGPT Get An Official Audio Input Feature?"></a>Will ChatGPT Get An Official Audio Input Feature?</h2><p> Despite popular demand for a voice input feature, OpenAI has kept its ChatGPT interface as basic as possible.

ChatGPT was released in November 2022, and Microsoft followed up shortly with a controlled roll-out of Bing AI, a worthy competitor, just months later.</p><p> Bard AI, Google’s ChatGPT alternative, has yet to impress despite Google’s massive investment in artificial intelligence and a reputation for innovation. Fortunately, at Google I&#x2F;O 2023, Google announced numerous new features that have the potential to supercharge Bard AI. We’ve compiled the most exciting Bard AI news announced at Google I&#x2F;O 2023.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4694919&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

No More Waitlist for Bard AI"></a>1. No More Waitlist for Bard AI</h2><p> While this isn’t entirely a new feature per se, it’s refreshing to know that Google has dropped the waitlist for using Bard and opened the chatbot to all. So, if you’ve been sneaking onto the Bard website using a VPN, it’s time to drop the mask. Bard is now open to over 180 countries and territories.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Dark-Theme"><a href="#2-Dark-Theme" class="headerlink" title="2.

To toggle on dark mode, toggle<strong>Use dark theme</strong> in the bottom left corner of the Bard web interface. If you are accessing Bard from your mobile browser, you’ll need to tap the menu icon in the top right corner of the Bard website to reveal the<strong>Use dark theme</strong> button in the bottom left corner.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296685&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2022/video-pp/ScreenshotSlider/Nero-Video-Advanced-editing.JPG"                      border="0"                >Simple and intuitive video editing<br>🎬 Nero Video:<br>The powerful video editing program for your Windows PC</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Integration-With-Google-Products-and-Third-Party-Plugins"><a href="#3-Integration-With-Google-Products-and-Third-Party-Plugins" class="headerlink" title="3.

Integration With Google Products and Third-Party Plugins</h2><p> This is one of the most significant Bard AI announcements since the chatbot itself was announced. Let’s face it; Bard AI isn’t as good as its competitors. We did a bit of a<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-bing-ai-vs-google-bard/" >ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard AI test <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and Bard didn’t impress. There are a lot of shortfalls we could talk about, but that’s a discussion for another day. The good news, however, is that a bulk of those shortfalls could be fixed by opening up Bard to third-party services and other Google products.</p><p> We saw a glimpse of what could be possible. A future where Bard AI integrates with Google Maps, Sheets, and a range of exciting services from third-party developers. This has the potential to be genuinely game-changing. Well, that is if Google doesn’t under-deliver, of course.</p><h2 id="4-Image-Prompting"><a href="#4-Image-Prompting" class="headerlink" title="4. Image Prompting"></a>4.

Unfortunately, as of 10th May 2023, even ChatGPT plus users are still fiddling their fingers, waiting to try out the feature. If you’ve been disappointed, don’t be anymore. Image prompting is coming to Bard AI. The feature will be powered by Google Lens, a technology that Google has developed for several years.</p><p> In other words, instead of just text prompts, you’ll be able to upload images as prompts alongside text. For example, you could upload a picture of a dog and ask Bard which dog breed it is. The specifics of the feature are still a mystery, but if it is well crafted, some compelling use cases could pop up.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901369&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix 4K - Software based live production. vMix 4K includes everything in vMix HD plus 4K support, PTZ control, External&#x2F;Fullscreen output, 4 Virtual Outputs, 1 Replay, 4 vMix Call, and 2 Recorders.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Image-Generation-With-Adobe-Firefly"><a href="#5-Image-Generation-With-Adobe-Firefly" class="headerlink" title="5.

If you generated a table with ChatGPT, for instance, copying over that table to a word processor with style intact is challenging.</p><p> Google is solving this by making content generated by Bard AI cross-compatible with some of its workspace tools like Google Sheets and Docs. So, if you generate data in a tabular format on Bard, you can export it to Sheets, where you can invite your family, friends, or colleagues to collaborate.</p><h2 id="7-Improved-Code-Generation"><a href="#7-Improved-Code-Generation" class="headerlink" title="7.

Google has now significantly ramped up Bard’s coding abilities—so much so that a lot of precious presentation time was dedicated to discussing it at its Google I&#x2F;O 2023 event.</p><p> Bard AI can now generate code in several programming languages. It can also explain code snippets, debug code, and sometimes point to the origin of the code to give credit to whoever created the original codebase that was used to answer your question.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006118/18460" target="_top" id="2006118"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006118"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006118/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Google’s-AI-Endgame-Is-Gemini"><a href="#Google’s-AI-Endgame-Is-Gemini" class="headerlink" title="Google’s AI Endgame Is Gemini"></a>Google’s AI Endgame Is Gemini</h2><p> Bard AI currently runs on PaLM 2 (the latest iteration of its PaLM large language model) and relies on different Google products and services to offer most of the features announced at Google I&#x2F;O 2023. Meanwhile, Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, briefly discussed Gemini—a new large language model currently being developed from the ground up to power future iterations of Bard AI.</p><p> According to Sundar Pichai, Gemini will be a multi-modal LLM, which means it will likely replace Google’s use of third-party services like Adobe Firefly or its products like Google Lens within the Bard AI ecosystem. Information about Gemini is still limited, but Google is investing in building a completely different LLM for Bard AI, and it will be worth paying attention to.

Although the concept of a vector database has been around for several decades, it is only now, in the age of large language models (LLMs), that vector databases can be used to their full potential.</p><p> Vector databases are particularly helpful in applications such as recommendation systems, image similarity search, anomaly detection, face detection, and natural language processing applications.</p><p> So, what exactly is a vector database?

Unlike the usual form of databases that organize data as tabulated lists, vector databases organize data through high-dimensional vectors.

For example, a two-dimensional embedding might look like “2, -3”, where 2 represents two units in the positive direction along the x-axis, while -3 represents a negative three units along the y-axis. While a three-dimensional embedding would look like “2, -3, 5”, where five places the data point 5 units in the positive direction of the z-axis.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ship7com.pxf.io/c/5597632/1509856/17634" target="_top" id="1509856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17634-1509856"                      border="0" alt="" width="730" height="383"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/05/dimensional-vector.jpg"                      alt="Two and three dimensional vectors"                ></p><p> Having more dimensions provides more context to what a piece of data is supposed to be.

Having a specialized database that can store, index, and query vector embeddings is essential to maximize the benefits of using vector embeddings. Furthermore, vector databases boost your AI by being a fast, reliable, and scalable database that can continuously help grow and train an AI model.</p><p> Since vector databases can expand the capabilities of an AI model, businesses and organizations may use a vector database for various applications, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Search Engines:</strong> Sometimes, people don’t know which keywords to use when querying. A vector database helps the system understand your query by analyzing the context and retrieving the closest keywords with the strongest correlation to your query.</li><li><strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> With vector databases extremely efficient at storing and retrieving data in combination with a large language model and memory, an AI system may learn things a person likes over time. This can then be automatically queried by an application to recommend various things that may interest a person.</li><li><strong>Image and Video Analysis:</strong> With video and image embedding models, AI models can be fine-tuned to work with images to find items that look similar to the query. This is currently being implemented in many online shopping apps and websites.</li><li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> By recording actions as embeddings, an<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-cybersecurity-making-world-more-secure/" >AI model can make the world more secure <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by detecting anomalies and certain outliers based on the norm.

These embedding models are what turn words, images, videos, and audio into numbers&#x2F;embeddings.</li><li><strong>Indexing:</strong> Once vector embeddings have been generated, they can now be stored on a vector database such as Pinecone, Milvus, and Chroma. These vector databases use various algorithms, such as product quantization (PQ) and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), to index each embedding for quick and efficient storing and retrieval of data.</li><li><strong>Querying:</strong> When an application issues a query, the query must first go through the same vector embedding model used to generate the stored data on the vector database. The generated vector query is then placed on the vector database, where the nearest vector is then retrieved as the most fitting answer to the query.</li></ol><h2 id="Popular-Vector-Databases"><a href="#Popular-Vector-Databases" class="headerlink" title="Popular Vector Databases"></a>Popular Vector Databases</h2><p> With the explosion of publicly available pre-trained models, vector databases rapidly gained popularity as expanded the capabilities and rate of fine-tuning of these models. And with such high demand for vector databases, many companies have started their own vector database services; here are some of the most popular ones:</p><ul><li><strong>Pinecone:</strong> A cloud-native vector database designed for fast similarity search. It features high scalability, analytics, and real-time insights, which is excellent for recommendation systems and image searches.</li><li><strong>Milvus</strong> : An open-source vector platform built with similarity search and AI applications in mind. It provides quick and efficient indexing and search capabilities for high-dimensional vectors. In addition, Milvus supports multiple indexing algorithms and offers SDKs for various programming languages.</li><li><strong>Redis:</strong> A high-performance vector database capable of supporting real-time applications, session management, and high-traffic websites. Redis is often used for real-time analytics, similarity search, and recommendation systems.</li><li><strong>Weaviate:</strong> Offers schema discovery, real-time updates, semantic search, and contextualizing data.

Pika is available on the web app and Discord. However, the platform you use determines the output quality and additional features you can access.</p><p> The web app allows you to modify specific regions in your generated clip, expand your video canvas, and add lip sync to your generated videos. These features aren’t available on the Discord server option.</p><p> That said, I recommend trying out the web and Discord options to see which gives you better results. The clip below was generated on Pika’s web version using the same prompt as the viral “Lady Walking in Tokyo” video by OpenAI Sora:</p><p>A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm glowing neon and animated city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress, and black boots, and carries a black purse. She wears sunglasses and red lipstick. She walks confidently and casually. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror effect of the colorful lights. Many pedestrians walk about.</p><p> Your browser does not support the video tag.</p><p> Using the same prompt (&#x2F;create + prompt) on Pika’s Discord server gave the result below:</p><p> Your browser does not support the video tag.</p><p> We’ll let you judge which is better, but it’s clear Pika has some catching up to do compared to the quality of Sora-generated clips online. However, its other features, like lip-syncing and image animation, give it an edge over Sora—at least for now.</p><h2 id="3-Pixverse"><a href="#3-Pixverse" class="headerlink" title="3 Pixverse"></a>3 <a class="link"   href="http://pixverse.ai/" >Pixverse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/screenshot-of-pixverse-homepage.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of pixverse homepage"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Free</strong></li></ul><p> Pixverse is another alternative to Open AI’s Sora that lets you create realistic videos with text prompts.

It’s time to start using it for gaming instead.</p><p> ChatGPT has a wealth of games in its custom GPT store, covering everything from, RPGs and Dungeons and Dragons-style adventures, classic retro games, card games, quizzes, mysteries, and so much more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Murder-Mystery-Mayhem"><a href="#1-Murder-Mystery-Mayhem" class="headerlink" title="1.Murder Mystery Mayhem"></a>1.<a class="link"   href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-82dEDeoN3-murder-mystery-mayhem" >Murder Mystery Mayhem <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p> Let’s start with one of the top-rated games on ChatGPT’s custom GPT store. Murder Mystery Mayhem is a procedurally generated game where you play the role of a detective in the year 1925.</p><p>Close</p><p> As with all good investigations, Murder Mystery Mayhem begins by setting the scene, including an image of the scene and the six suspects, along with names, roles, and potential interview points. You then begin questioning each suspect, attempting to find holes in their story, check alibis, and uncover crucial evidence.</p><p> The story isn’t completely linear, but you don’t have much room to develop your detective’s character. I wrote that “I was pacing the room, looking at each suspect in turn, trying to detect a tell, anger, or worry,” but was informed that was outside the boundaries of the game by the Officer (the police officer present at the investigation with you).</p><p> Once you finger your suspect, you call in the Officer to make the arrest. Collar the wrong perp, and the game is over, and you begin with a new mystery.</p><p> Murder Mystery Mayhem is good fun, with the location and murderer changing round by round, and each suspect has new alibis and evidence to reveal. The changes keep it feeling fresh, and one game played through to the end can keep you engaged and seeking the truth for well over an hour. (Don’t forget, you don’t have to play it all at once!)</p><h2 id="2-Oregon-Trail"><a href="#2-Oregon-Trail" class="headerlink" title="2.Oregon Trail"></a>2.<a class="link"   href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-ijJRJgWHp-oregon-trail" >Oregon Trail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p> Dying of dysentery has become a longstanding meme from the original Oregon Trail game, but you can now relive that horrifying experience in ChatGPT. The Oregan Trail custom GPT brings one of the first edu-games (not_the_ first, mind!) to ChatGPT… where you can suffer through the wilderness all over again.</p><p>Close</p><p> You begin as the Oregon Trail does: choosing your character and buying supplies, then heading out into the wilderness. Most of your input to the game is choosing between the numbered options, such as where to head next, whether to buy more supplies, explore a new area, hunt for supplies, talk to the locals, look at the map, and so on.</p><p> It’s a basic version of the classic game, but it’s engaging enough. The custom GPT’s scripting doesn’t allow you to go off-piste and, say, rob the local convenience store for supplies (nor did the original), but it’s certainly a lot easier without so many setbacks constantly upending and destroying your party. It’s a much easier version, that’s for sure.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087267/19272" target="_top" id="2087267"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087267"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087267/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Poker"><a href="#3-Poker" class="headerlink" title="3.Poker"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-lHyTLJaCX-poker" >Poker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p> From the potential death and horror of the Oregon Trail to something a little more relaxing: Poker. You play against the AI in this Poker custom GPT, starting with 10,000 credits, and play standard five-card Texas hold’em until someone’s credits run out.</p><p>Close</p><p> My only major gripe about this poker game is that ChatGPT seems to mimic your choices, such as check, raise, and so on, which can make the game predictable (or at least less random).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Console-GPT"><a href="#4-Console-GPT" class="headerlink" title="4.Console GPT"></a>4.<a class="link"   href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-3p94K4Djb-console-gpt" >Console GPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p> Now, this is a cool idea of how a custom GPT can span multiple types of input to create a custom game with a unique storyline.</p><p> When you first boot Console GPT, you meet the message “BOOT UP AND INSERT GAME.” But you don’t have a game cartridge to boot yet. Instead, you have to head to the<a class="link"   href="https://glif.app/@fab1an/glifs/clotu9ul2002vl90fh6cmpjw0" >Console GPT Glif page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is a custom AI art tool that will create your “cartridge.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cyber-syndicate-cartridge-ai-image.jpg"                      alt="cyber syndicate cartridge ai image"                ></p><p> Input the type of game you want in the text box, select<strong>Glif It!</strong> , and watch as your creation comes to life. I went with “retro-futurism crime lord” and was presented with “Cyber Syndicate,” a game where you “navigate a neon-soaked, cyberpunk metropolis teeming with high-tech heists and digital espionage,” with a goal of becoming the ultimate syndicate leader.</p><p> Now, download the Cyber Syndicate cartridge (as an image; it’s not really a cartridge file) by hovering over the image and selecting<strong>Download</strong> .</p><p> Head back to Console GPT and use the image upload button to insert the cartridge. For me, Cyber Syndicate instantly whirrs into life, declaring “COMPATIBLE CARTRIDGE DETECTED. LOADING ‘CYBER SYNDICATE.’” The first scenario boots along with a 70 percent full health bar, three options, and, most interestingly, the option to visualize the scene.</p><p>Close</p><p> The narrative flow is a bit shaky, and Console GPT could use some extra commands to remember other parts of the story, but it’s good fun for a while. For example, one moment, I was a lone operative in a bar, and the next, I was planning a heist in a room with the rest of my assembled team.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698"                      border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Cookie-Clicker"><a href="#5-Cookie-Clicker" class="headerlink" title="5.Cookie Clicker"></a>5.<a class="link"   href="http://chat.openai.com/g/g-g0b22bvqB-cookie-clicker" >Cookie Clicker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p> Not content with card games, custom cartridge adventures, or adventuring? Why not give a custom GPT idle game a try instead?</p><p>Close</p><p> I have to say, this implementation of Cookie Clicker is jarring. Cookie Clicker is one of the most well-known idle games of all time, building up your cookie income over time.</p><p> The custom GPT Cookie Clicker is decidedly different. You’re still building up a cookie empire in a similar style, but because ChatGPT doesn’t run automated commands and cannot keep the numbers ticking over like the original game, it requires more input.</p><p> Still, if you’re into idle games and want to try something different, it could be worth a try.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4576829&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9e740b84bb48a64dde25061566299467/products/copy_1_jp_box_big.png"                      border="0"                >Jet Profiler for MySQL, Enterprise Version： Jet Profiler for MySQL is real-time query performance and diagnostics tool for the MySQL database server.

Cute Little Zombies is a perfect example of why its text adventures are great, giving you a heap of different scenarios to play through, all with cute little AI-generated images to help build the story out.</p><p>Close</p><p> You’re first presented with a list to choose your preferred type of zombie apocalypse. Perhaps you prefer a “Classic Horde,” or maybe you’re more into a “Biotech Disaster” or “Apocalyptic Cult?” Either way, Cute Little Zombies’ list of eight scenarios has you covered. Once you select, the game sets the scene, dropping you into a world filled with ravenous zombies, ready to make you one of their own.</p><p> What I like about Cute Little Zombies is that along with the numbered action options, it also makes it clear you can enter another action you want to take, which helps make the game a little more personal. Plus, the images created within the custom GPT game are ridiculously cute, and the storytelling is decent. I mean, it’s not going to win any prizes for writing, but it’s good enough to draw you in.</p><p> Gaming on ChatGPT is fun, but there is one major frustration that cannot be escaped: ChatGPT’s input limit. As you can only send ChatGPT Plus a limited number of messages (around 40 every three hours), any in-depth gaming will be interrupted periodically to reset the counter. The counter doesn’t roll over, either. You’re not building up extra hours of ChatGPT messages by not messaging; ChatGPT tracks your usage from when you send your first message during a session.</p><p> ChatGPT’s games are entertaining, and custom GPT games can add an extra dimension with some clever designs, but that limit means you’ll always have more fun with a regular game instead.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Perplexity AI is also perfect for answering those random questions that pop into your head, from “How to make a homemade kite?” and “Why do we stuff pillows with feathers?” to much more complex queries. It provides quick, reliable answers that satisfy your curiosity.</p><p> Perplexity is free to use. However, you can upgrade to its Pro plan ($20&#x2F;month) for access to additional features, such as unlimited access to its more powerful AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus and Sonnet, and Mistral’s Large, plus support for images and files, and better support.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Can-Perplexity-AI-Replace-Google"><a href="#Can-Perplexity-AI-Replace-Google" class="headerlink" title="Can Perplexity AI Replace Google?"></a>Can Perplexity AI Replace Google?</h2><p> While Perplexity AI offers a unique value proposition, it’s not positioned to replace Google entirely. Google’s vast data infrastructure and established user base give it an advantage in many areas. Perplexity excels in providing AI overviews of user queries. However, it’s not effective for several other uses that Google has come to be known for, like weather forecasts and geo-sensitive queries.</p><p> For example, a search for “bakery near me” returned a “summary” of a list of bakeries. The interesting part? Not one from its list was within a 100-mile radius. The same query on Google returned options within a five-mile radius, which is absolutely what I wanted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-showing-search-result-on-perplexity.jpg"                      alt="screenshot showing search result on perplexity"                ></p><p> It’s worth noting that<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-access-google-ai-powered-search/" >Google has been testing Search Generative Experience (SGE) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , an AI-assisted search feature. SGE provides AI overviews of search queries similar to Perplexity AI. Perplexity AI currently does a better job of answering queries thoroughly and also provides in-text citations for cross-referencing. However, this is something Google can replicate, if it becomes where the battle line is drawn.</p><p> Perplexity AI is reportedly working on bringing ads to its platform, per<a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/1/24118154/perplexity-will-try-a-form-of-ads-on-its-ai-search-platform" >The Verge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . How it executes its ad features will determine much of the platform’s future. Perplexity has a lot to prove (and improve!) to really stand up to Google.</p><p> Perplexity AI’s journey is one to watch, as it has the potential to carve out a significant niche in the search engine market. Its success will largely depend on how it integrates additional capabilities and responds to user feedback. Whether it will ever stand toe-to-toe with Google remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Perplexity AI is a tool worth watching and, more importantly, using.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

We’ve all been there, endlessly navigating through a sea of titles, hounding friends for recommendations, but still falling short of that ‘aha’ moment.</p><p> Wouldn’t it be great if ChatGPT could step in as your trusty sidekick, curating the ideal movie selection for you? Sounds interesting? Well, here’s a thrilling guide on how to use ChatGPT to figure out what to watch next.</p><h2 id="1-Identify-Similar-Movies-and-TV-Shows"><a href="#1-Identify-Similar-Movies-and-TV-Shows" class="headerlink" title="1. Identify Similar Movies and TV Shows"></a>1. Identify Similar Movies and TV Shows</h2><p> You’ve just seen the last episode of “The Last of Us,” “Succession.” or whichever movie keeps you glued to the screen. Now you need similar TV shows, but Google keeps turning up suggestions that make your stomach turn. How do you dig out TV shows similar to what you’ve just finished watching? ChatGPT can help you<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/find-perfect-movie-watch-right-now/" >find the perfect movie to stream next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> With its massive collection of detailed information on movies and TV shows, getting ChatGPT to suggest films similar to the ones you love is easy and exciting. Simply tell ChatGPT the name of the film, the elements of it you like, and the elements you dislike, and the AI chatbot will pull similar films that match your likes.</p><p> If you are not sure how to prompt ChatGPT for similar movies? Here’s a great prompt to get you started:</p><p>Imagine you are a movie and TV show recommendation expert. A user wants to find similar TV shows or movies to a particular one they’ve enjoyed. Your task is to give the user 9 of the most relevant suggestions based on the elements of the movie or TV show they really liked. Ask the user the questions below and use the replies to make the most relevant suggestions:</p><pre><code>                1. What are the names of the movies or TV shows? e.g., Game of Thrones, Legend of the Seeker [Required]                2. Which elements of the movie or TV show did you like most? e.g., Heist scenes and sword fights [Optional]                Present the suggestions in a table format, including columns for the similarity score, the reason for the similarity score, and a general quality/critic rating. Begin by asking the user question 1.</code></pre><p> We used the prompt above and then asked ChatGPT to provide TV shows similar to “The Walking Dead” :</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3922934&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/ripperpro.png"                      border="0"                >WonderFox DVD Ripper Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/similar-tv-shows-recommendation-from-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="Similar tv shows recommendation from ChatGPT"                ></p><h2 id="2-Try-a-Different-Genre"><a href="#2-Try-a-Different-Genre" class="headerlink" title="2. Try a Different Genre"></a>2. Try a Different Genre</h2><p> Are you tired of seeing the same genre of movies but have no clue what else you’d love? You’re not alone. Fortunately, ChatGPT can help out. Simply tell ChatGPT what you’ve had enough of, and prompt it to surprise you with something radically different.</p><p> If you have a hard time turning that into a prompt, below is a good example you could take a clue from.</p><p>I’ve seen a lot of TV shows based on spy, romance, and war themes. I want you to surprise me with something radically different, preferably from a different genre, and explain why they’re worth watching. It could be from any country. Include the quality&#x2F;critic rating and the production year.</p><p>Trying the prompt above, we had:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1596691/17882" target="_top" id="1596691"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1596691"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1596691/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/radically-different-tv-shows.jpg"                      alt="radically different TV shows"                ></p><h2 id="3-Identify-Movies-With-a-Desired-Storyline"><a href="#3-Identify-Movies-With-a-Desired-Storyline" class="headerlink" title="3. Identify Movies With a Desired Storyline"></a>3. Identify Movies With a Desired Storyline</h2><p> Sometimes you have an idea of the kind of movies you want to watch; you just don’t know how to find them. Googling might help if you have a general theme like “undercover spy in an enemy country.” However, if you have a detailed storyline, Google might not be much help, but ChatGPT excels at that.</p><p> Let’s say you need a TV show with a female protagonist who is underestimated at first but undergoes personal growth to emerge as a force to reckon with later in the movie. Good luck explaining that to Google. However, ChatGPT can carefully analyze each element of that description and come up with the best possible matches.</p><p> Difficulties writing a prompt that does this?<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/prompting-techniques-to-improve-chatgpt-responses/" >Here’s a guide on how to write great ChatGPT prompts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Below is an example prompt you can take a cue from:</p><p>I would like to request a list of five TV shows that feature a female protagonist who learns to fight from a young age but faces ridicule and underestimation from male characters. Over the course of the series, the female lead should demonstrate remarkable growth, emerging as a powerful warrior capable of overcoming obstacles and defeating enemies.</p><p>We tried the prompt above and got some very enticing suggestions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851691&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tv-shows-with-a-certain-storyline-1.jpg"                      alt="TV shows with a certain storyline-1"                ></p><h2 id="4-Help-Remember-a-Movie-You’ve-Forgotten"><a href="#4-Help-Remember-a-Movie-You’ve-Forgotten" class="headerlink" title="4.

Help Remember a Movie You’ve Forgotten</h2><p> You probably have that one movie you’ve seen in the past and would love to see again but can’t remember the name. Maybe you saw it at a young age or just don’t have great luck with keeping movie names in memory. ChatGPT can help you hunt down that elusive movie. Just describe every bit of the movie you can remember. Names of any actor you can recall, major scenes, storyline, every element you can think of, and let ChatGPT do its magic.</p><p>Below is an example of a prompt that can help you with such a request:</p><p>​​​​​​​Hey, I need to recall the name of a movie I saw several years ago. I recall that Jet Li was a lead actor alongside a black actor with a low haircut. It involved a lot of fight scenes. The black actor was quite funny. There’s this particular scene where both actors had to fight some bad guys from China, probably hit men, can’t recall. Give me some movies that could likely match this description.</p><p> When we tried the prompt above, we had the exact movie we had in mind, which was the 2000 movie “Romeo Must Die.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.mirillis.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4704640&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/547a5a56d43f6d40f9a6a2f76501d013/products/1_mirillis_action_boxshot_store_1x.jpg"                      border="0"                ><br>    Home Use license is dedicated for personal, non-commercial use only.<br>    If Action! is used for commercial gain or to further any commercial purpose,<br>    a Commercial Use license is required.

Use ChatGPT to Discover Lesser-Known or Underrated Movies</h2><p> There are a lot of hidden gems sitting around in the catalogs of streaming services. A number of them are better than similar titles with better publicity. ChatGPT can help you discover some of these lesser-known movies you may have overlooked.</p><p> How? You can start by using prompts like: “Can you suggest some hidden gems in the comedy genre that most people haven’t seen?” Or “What are some underrated historical Korean TV shows that deserve more attention, why are they worth seeing, and what’s their IMDB score?”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/underated-korean-tv-series-suggested-by-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="Underated Korean Tv series suggested by ChatGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Research-Movies-Starring-Your-Favorite-Actors"><a href="#6-Research-Movies-Starring-Your-Favorite-Actors" class="headerlink" title="6.

Its new large language model (LLM) boasts a lot of improvement over its predecessor (PaLM) and might finally be ready to take on its biggest rival, OpenAI’s GPT-4.</p><p> But just how much improvement has Google made? Is PaLM 2 the difference maker Google hopes it will be, and more importantly, with so many similar capabilities, how is PaLM 2 different from OpenAI’s GPT-4?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072200/17885" target="_top" id="2072200"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072200"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072200/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="PaLM-2-vs-GPT-4-Performance-Overview"><a href="#PaLM-2-vs-GPT-4-Performance-Overview" class="headerlink" title="PaLM 2 vs. GPT-4: Performance Overview"></a>PaLM 2 vs. GPT-4: Performance Overview</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-google-palm-2/" >PaLM 2 is packed with new and improved capabilities <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over its predecessor. One of the unique advantages PaLM 2 has over GPT-4 is that it’s available in smaller sizes specific to certain applications that do not have as much onboard processing power.</p><p> All these different sizes have their own smaller models called Gecko, Otter, Bison, and Unicorn, with Gecko being the smallest, followed by Otter, Bison, and finally, Unicorn, the largest model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/neon-pink-brain-image-on-a-black-background.jpg"                      alt="Neon Pink Brain Image on a Black Background"                ></p><p> Google also claims an improvement in reasoning capabilities over GPT-4 in WinoGrande and DROP, with the former pulling a narrow margin in ARC-C. However, there’s significant improvement across the board regarding PaLM and SOTA.</p><p> PaLM 2 is also better at math, according to Google’s 91-page<a class="link"   href="https://ai.google/static/documents/palm2techreport.pdf" >PaLM 2 research paper <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> [PDF]. However, the way Google and OpenAI have structured their test results makes it difficult to compare the two models directly. Google also omitted some comparisons, likely because PaLM 2 didn’t perform nearly as well as GPT-4.</p><p> In MMLU, GPT-4 scored 86.4, while PaLM 2 scored 81.2. The same goes for HellaSwag, where GPT-4 scored 95.3, but PaLM 2 could only muster 86.8, and ARC-E, where GPT-4 and PaLM 2 got 96.3 and 89.7, respectively.</p><p> The largest model in the PaLM 2 family is PaLM 2-L. While we don’t know its exact size, we do know that it’s significantly smaller than the largest PaLM model but uses more training computing.<a class="link"   href="http://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html" >According to Google <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , PaLM has 540 billion parameters, so the “significantly smaller” should put PaLM 2 anywhere between 10 billion to 300 billion parameters. Do keep in mind that these numbers are just assumptions based on what Google has said in the PaLM 2 paper.</p><p> If this number is anywhere close to 100 billion or under, PaLM 2 is most likely smaller in terms of parameters than GPT-3.5. Considering a model potentially under 100 billion can go toe to toe with GPT-4 and even beat it at some tasks is impressive.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/gpt-models-explained-and-compared/" >GPT-3.5 initially blew everything out of the water <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , including PaLM, but PaLM 2 has made quite the recovery.</p><p> Another obvious performance advantage that PaLM 2 carries over GPT-4 is its availability in different sizes. This means that different versions of the model, Gecko, for instance, can run on mobile devices, even without an internet connection, and provide onboard AI capabilities—something we’re yet to see from GPT-4. This kind of on-device processing gives PaLM 2 an edge over GPT-4 when it comes to accessibility and deployment.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4693127&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videosoftdev.com/images/video_editor/screenshots/1.jpg"                      border="0"                ><br>VSDC Pro Video Editor is a light professional non-linear video editing suite for creating a movie of any complexity.

OpenAI also took the same approach when unveiling GPT-4, making no claims about the size of the training dataset.</p><p> However, Google wanted to focus on a deeper understanding of mathematics, logic, reasoning, and science, meaning a large part of PaLM 2’s training data is focused on the aforementioned topics. Google says in its paper that PaLM 2’s pre-training corpus is composed of multiple sources, including web documents, books, code, mathematics, and conversational data, giving it improvements across the board, at least when compared to PaLM.</p><p> PaLM 2’s conversational skills should also be on another level, considering the model has been trained in over 100 languages to give it a better contextual understanding and better translation capabilities. That said, Google claims that PaLM 2 will generate less toxic output primarily because it was trained on less data, avoiding websites that might contain hate speech or other toxic behavior. Large textual sources such as Reddit have reportedly not been included in the training set, leading to a “cleaner” output of sorts.</p><p> As far as GPT-4’s training data is concerned, OpenAI has told us that it has trained the model using publicly available data and the data it licensed.<a class="link"   href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4" >GPT-4’s research page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> states, “The data is a web-scale corpus of data including correct and incorrect solutions to math problems, weak and strong reasoning, self-contradictory and consistent statements, and representing a great variety of ideologies and ideas.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048963/16384" target="_top" id="2048963"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048963"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048963/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-chatgpt-logo-over-a-photograph-of-an-essay-written-on-a-laptop.jpg"                      alt="the ChatGPT logo over a photograph of an essay written on a laptop"                ></p><p> When GPT-4 is asked a question, it can produce a wide variety of responses, not all of which might be relevant to your query. To align it with the user’s intent, OpenAI fine-tuned the model’s behavior using reinforcement learning with human feedback.</p><p> While we may not know the exact training data either of these models were trained on, we know that the training intent was very different. We’ll have to wait and see how this difference in training intent differentiates between the two models in a real-world deployment.</p><p> That said, the sheer volume of training data used for GPT-4 means that it has an advantage when it comes to understanding the nuances of language and should theoretically generate higher-quality outputs. However, this also means that OpenAI needs to put stronger restrictions in place to keep the model from going haywire, something that Google can avoid, considering it left potentially toxic sources out of the training data.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="PaLM-2-and-GPT-4-Chatbots-and-Services"><a href="#PaLM-2-and-GPT-4-Chatbots-and-Services" class="headerlink" title="PaLM 2 and GPT-4 Chatbots and Services"></a>PaLM 2 and GPT-4 Chatbots and Services</h2><p> The first portal to access both the LLMs is using their respective chatbots, PaLM 2’s Bard and GPT-4’s ChatGPT. That said, GPT-4 is behind a paywall with ChatGPT Plus, and free users only get access to GPT-3.5. Bard, on the other hand, is free for all and available across 180 countries.</p><p> That’s not to say you can’t access GPT-4 for free, either. Microsoft’s Bing AI Chat uses GPT-4 and is completely free, open to all, and available right next to Bing Search, Google’s biggest rival in the space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/emoji-wallpapers-android.jpg"                      alt="Setting an emoji wallpaper on Android"                ></p><p> Google I&#x2F;O 2023 was filled with announcements about how PaLM 2 and generative AI integration will improve the Google Workspace experience with AI features coming to Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, and just about every service the search giant offers. In addition, Google has confirmed that PaLM 2 has already been integrated into over 25 Google products, including Android and YouTube.</p><p> In comparison, Microsoft has already brought AI features to the Microsoft Office suite of programs and many of its services. At the moment, you can experience both LLMs in their versions of similar offerings from two rival companies going head to head in the AI battle.</p><p> However, since GPT-4 came out early and has been careful to avoid many of the blunders Google made with the original Bard, it has been the de facto LLM for third-party developers, startups, and just about anyone else looking to incorporate a capable AI model in their service so far.

The fact that PaLM 2 is open-source, instead of being locked behind a paid API, means it has the potential to be more widely adopted than GPT-4.</p><p> All things considered, at the moment, the PaLM 2-powered Bard appears to be the better choice when it comes to research as it is better at answering questions with relevant information and accessing the latest information on the internet about any given subject.<a class="link"   href="https://bard.google.com/updates" >According to Bard’s latest update <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , delivered on September 19, 2023, Bard is now using its “most capable model yet” with support for another 40 languages, in-depth coding assistance, the ability to present different perspectives on a given topic, and general quality and accuracy improvements.</p><p> You also get the option of double-checking Bard’s responses with Google searches. However, on the performance front, the model still takes longer to generate responses as compared to the GPT-4 powered ChatGPT or Bing Chat.</p><h2 id="Can-PaLM-2-Take-on-GPT-4"><a href="#Can-PaLM-2-Take-on-GPT-4" class="headerlink" title="Can PaLM 2 Take on GPT-4?"></a>Can PaLM 2 Take on GPT-4?</h2><p> PaLM 2 is still very new, so the answer to whether or not it can take on GPT-4 remains to be answered. However, with everything that Google is promising and the aggressive manner it has decided to use to propagate it, it does look like PaLM 2 can give GPT-4 a run for its money. With Google’s ongoing development of a multimodal AI model called Gemini also in the works, it’s about time for OpenAI to get on its toes.</p><p> However, GPT-4 is still quite a capable model and, as mentioned before, beats PaLM 2 in quite a few comparisons. That said, PaLM 2’s multiple smaller models give it an irrefutable edge. Gecko itself is so lightweight that it can work on mobile devices, even when offline. This means that PaLM 2 can support an entirely different class of products and devices that might struggle to use GPT-4.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-AI-Race-Is-Heating-Up"><a href="#The-AI-Race-Is-Heating-Up" class="headerlink" title="The AI Race Is Heating Up"></a>The AI Race Is Heating Up</h2><p> With the launch of PaLM2, the race for AI dominance has heated up, as this might just be the first worthy opponent to go against GPT-4.

But what reliable ChatGPT alternatives can you turn to when the chatbot is not an option?</p><p>Here are the best ChatGPT alternatives.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453720/17020" target="_top" id="1453720"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453720"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453720/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Claude-AI"><a href="#1-Claude-AI" class="headerlink" title="1.Claude AI"></a>1.<a class="link"   href="https://claude.ai/" >Claude AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-of-the-claude-ai-chat-interface.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of the Claude AI chat interface"                ></p><p> Claude AI is undoubtedly the best alternative to ChatGPT. In the fast-moving world of AI, that status might change in a few days, weeks, or months, but it is the next best prospect in the AI chatbot space at the time of writing. You’ll be hard-pressed to find an AI chatbot that gets as close to ChatGPT in creativity, common sense reasoning, and accuracy as Claude AI.</p><p> How does it weigh against ChatGPT?<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-claude-ai-chatbot-better-than-chatgpt/" >Claude AI outshines ChatGPT in four key areas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> while comfortably holding its own on several key metrics. It has stricter safety measures, larger context length, a more recent knowledge base, and, it seems, particularly better creative writing tasks.</p><p> You can learn<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/sign-up-claude-ai/" >how to sign up and start using Claude AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . As a rising star in the AI chatbot space, and with a few more iterations, Claude might achieve a true peer status with ChatGPT—or even eventually outperform it.</p><h2 id="2-Google-Gemini"><a href="#2-Google-Gemini" class="headerlink" title="2.Google Gemini"></a>2.<a class="link"   href="https://bard.google.com/" >Google Gemini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bard-explaining-what-makeuseof-does.jpg"                      alt="Bard explaining what MakeUseOf does"                ></p><p> Another worthy alternative to ChatGPT is Google’s Gemini, formerly Bard AI. After Claude AI, Google’s Gemini is probably the most powerful and widely used ChatGPT alternative that doesn’t rely on OpenAI’s GPT language model. Aptly named, the AI chatbot is currently powered by Google’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/is-google-gemini-better-than-chatgpt/" >Gemini family of large language models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a move away from the poorly performing<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-google-palm-2/" >PaLM 2 large language model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Although Google’s Gemini AI model is similar to OpenAI’s GPT at the architectural level, there is a noticeable difference in the practical capabilities of the two language models. Regardless, Google is always trying to build the capabilities of its chatbot to be on par with ChatGPT. Recently, Gemini has been supercharged with new abilities that enable it to generate stunning AI images, just as ChatGPT currently does.</p><p> While Gemini is quite powerful in its own right, ChatGPT enjoys the advantage of being powered by a model that has undergone several iterations of qualitative improvement. Although we can argue that Google’s rebranded Gemini has gone through a similar pipeline of quality-focused development, it hasn’t really been at the same pace and depth as ChatGPT.</p><p> Notwithstanding, Gemini has improved massively from its early days, now boasting impressive abilities, including experimental audio and video processing abilities that could potentially be a game-changer when fully rolled out. It is a good tool for crafting write-ups like articles and emails and has commendable mathematical abilities. It is also a useful programming aid and quite an effective tool for learning a new language.</p><p> There<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-google-bard/" >are some creative ways to use Google’s Gemini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and if you’re wondering how Gemini stacks up against ChatGPT, take a look at our in-depth analysis<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-google-bard/" >comparing ChatGPT vs. Gemini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg"                      border="0"                >PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

Microsoft Copilot blends results from the web, OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, and Microsoft’s proprietary technology to produce factual and up-to-date results for millions of its users worldwide. Like ChatGPT, Copilot can also generate stunning images using the DALL-E image generation model, although the quality of images from Copilot sometimes seems less appealing than those generated from DALL-E on ChatGPT.</p><p> Copilot is intricately tethered to the internet and can provide real-time information about trends and events, which means it provides more relevant responses to prompts “by default” than your regular ChatGPT.</p><p> In addition to using OpenAI’s GPT and DALL-E models, Copilot Chat also benefits from Microsoft’s vast wealth of AI resources, giving it an edge over most of the ChatGPT alternatives on our list. If you want to know how Copilot compares to the much more popular ChatGPT, read through our<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-bing-ai-chatbot/" >ChatGPT vs. Microsoft Copilot comparison <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600114&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Mac： Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Perplexity-AI"><a href="#4-Perplexity-AI" class="headerlink" title="4.Perplexity AI"></a>4.<a class="link"   href="https://www.perplexity.ai/" >Perplexity AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/perplexity-pro-account-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="Perplexity pro account screenshot"                ></p><p> Like Microsoft’s Copilot, Perplexity AI is an AI-powered search engine and chatbot that synthesizes real-time web data and knowledge from its underlying AI model to provide accurate and comprehensive answers to user queries. Perplexity is one of the most reliable alternatives to ChatGPT because it is powered by OpenAI’s GPT technology.</p><p> However, unlike other AI chatbots that are simply “powered by GPT” and do nothing unique, Perplexity has a few interesting features you’ll find useful, particularly its ability to regularize GPT data with current information it sources from the internet. Perplexity AI is also great at citing sources in its responses and providing links you might need for further research on a topic. Its free plan is powered by the GPT-3.5 language model, while the Pro plan, priced at $20 per month, is powered by the more powerful GPT-4 language model.

However, Pi, developed by AI startup Inflection, stands out in its unique interpretation of conversational AI. The chatbot might not be the most advanced AI, but it is one of the most interesting when it comes to holding engaging conversations.</p><p> You’ll ask other chatbots questions, and they’ll provide you with a response, and that’s just about that. Pi AI goes the extra mile to make sure that you get the best conversational experience, almost always responding to your queries with a subtle push to keep you engaged in more conversations. It doesn’t have the shiny fancy features you’ll find in other front-runner chatbots like ChatGPT, but it can provide accurate and detailed answers to most of the questions you throw at it. We highly recommend you give it a try whenever you need a chatbot that is interesting to talk to.</p><h2 id="6-OpenAI-GPT-Playground"><a href="#6-OpenAI-GPT-Playground" class="headerlink" title="6.OpenAI GPT Playground"></a>6.<a class="link"   href="https://beta.openai.com/playground" >OpenAI GPT Playground <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296740&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/biu/Nero_BackItUp_Screen_2.webp"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/openai-gpt-3-5-playground.jpg"                      alt="OpenAI GPT-3.5 Playground"                ></p><p> Even before ChatGPT went viral, there was OpenAI’s GPT Playground, a platform for the public to play with different iterations of OpenAI’s GPT AI models. Unfortunately, the tool didn’t create as much buzz as ChatGPT has. This is partly because of its technical user interface and lack of consumer-focused publicity.</p><p> Ironically, although ChatGPT is getting much of the spotlight, the GPT models available at the Playground are much larger and more powerful than the variants that power ChatGPT. The models you can access at the Playground are undoubtedly one of the most powerful AI language models around.</p><p> ChatGPT is like an iteration of the GPT model used at the Playground, but it has been better streamlined and fine-tuned to be more conversational and human-like in its response. These streamlined models can better understand human intent, provide context-specific answers, and sustain coherent conversations.</p><p> You can picture the Playground as ChatGPT for power users. You can tweak it to do what ChatGPT does and even much more. There are more options and settings to customize the AI model to behave differently. You’ll also likely notice some differences in the responses from ChatGPT and those you get from the Playground, especially if you tweak the available parameters.</p><p> While ChatGPT will refuse to answer questions on some sensitive topics, the Playground model is less likely to refuse to answer questions. If you’d love to get handy with the Playground, here’s a guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-gpt-3-openai-playground/" >how to use the GPT Playground <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="7-Poe-by-Quora"><a href="#7-Poe-by-Quora" class="headerlink" title="7.Poe by Quora"></a>7.<a class="link"   href="http://poe.com/" >Poe by Quora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/poe-ai.jpg"                      alt="Poe AI"                ></p><p> Unlike the other options on our list, Poe by Quora is less of an AI chatbot and more of an AI platform. Poe gives you access to some of the most established AI large language models currently available online. The platform has everything from Google’s PaLM and Gemini, Meta’s Llama, and Anthropic’s Claude to several iterations of OpenAI’s GPT large language models.</p><p> How good is Poe? Well, let’s say the biggest allure of using Poe is its array of choices. You could say Poe is as good as a combination of the chatbots available on the platform. Although you might not get the same quality of service as you’d get when using the individual chatbots directly on their original provider’s platform, you’ll love Poe’s flexibility. Things get much better if you take up Poe’s $20 monthly subscription, which is cost-effective considering the number of AI models at your disposal. In comparison, the same amount gives you access to a ChatGPT Plus subscription for a month.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851655&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-YouChat"><a href="#8-YouChat" class="headerlink" title="8.YouChat"></a>8.<a class="link"   href="https://you.com/search?q=who+are+you&tbm=youchat" >YouChat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/you-com-august-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="You.com August screenshot"                ></p><p> YouChat, like most ChatGPT alternatives on our list, is powered by a combination of OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 AI models. Its GPT-4 model capabilities are slapped behind a $20 monthly subscription, although you get a few free GPT-4 credits to try out the chatbot. Unless you subscribe to the YouChat Pro plan, your queries should be powered by the slightly older GPT-3.5 series model. This should give you roughly similar results to the capabilities of the free-tier ChatGPT, although with more summarized results that are heavily synthesized with live internet data.</p><p> YouChat has a sleek, colorful interface and is neatly interwoven into You.com’s search engine. As a result, YouChat can act as a search engine that gives you a list of links to indexed web pages relevant to your query. Or, you can get the typical ChatGPT-styled conversational responses for questions. If you are looking for a search engine and a chatbot like ChatGPT rolled into one product, then YouChat is an excellent option.</p><p> Although YouChat uses OpenAI’s GPT models, just like Perplexity AI and Microsoft’s Copliot, it uses proprietary technology to augment the results provided by the underlying GPT model to provide users with up-to-date information.</p><p> Besides a few limitations, YouChat is a simple and powerful ChatGPT alternative that deserves exposure.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713565&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png"                      border="0"                >Epubor Audible Converter for Mac： Download and convert Audible AAXC&#x2F;AA&#x2F;AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="9-Chatsonic"><a href="#9-Chatsonic" class="headerlink" title="9.Chatsonic"></a>9.<a class="link"   href="https://writesonic.com/chat" >Chatsonic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chatsonic-august-2023-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="Chatsonic August 2023 screenshot"                ></p><p> The underlying technology behind ChatGPT (first GPT 3.5, since updated to GPT-4) is the same technology that powers Chatsonic, making it almost as interesting as ChatGPT. Chatsonic goes a step further and builds on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >the abilities of ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> while fixing<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >some of ChatGPT’s limitations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Just like ChatGPT, Chatsonic uses the DALL-E image generation model to create images on command right on the Chatsonic chat interface. Alongside DALL-E, there’s also the option of using Stable Diffusion to create AI art on the Chatsonic platform.</p><p> However, Chatsonic is not all rosy. Although you’ll get freemium access when you sign up, unlike ChatGPT, Chatsonic is mostly a paid service. You get allocated tokens, and once you’re out of tokens, you’ll have to stick with the barebones on offer. Also, compared to ChatGPT, Chatsonic isn’t great with computer codes.</p><p> Compared with Chatsonic, ChatGPT responses are typically significantly more “complete” and better formatted. In several cases, Chatsonic tends to summarize its responses. That might work for some people, but you might not find it useful when you need a long-form response. However, those limitations aside, Chatsonic is exciting and one of the best ChatGPT alternatives.</p><h2 id="10-Character-AI"><a href="#10-Character-AI" class="headerlink" title="10.Character.AI"></a>10.<a class="link"   href="https://character.ai/" >Character.AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-of-charcater-ai-website.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of charcater AI website"                ></p><p> Character.AI is precisely what it says in the name—a character-theme AI chatbot that lets you simulate interaction with popular celebrities, historical figures, or movie characters. From political figures like Donald Trump to movie characters like Iron Man’s Tony Stark, Character AI has a large and interesting selection of characters to interact with on the platform.</p><p> We tried out a conversation with Tony Stark about getting an Iron Man-style suit, and it was interesting, immersive, and logical. Character AI impressively reflects the tone and mannerisms of the characters on offer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/conversation-with-tony-stark-on-character-ai.jpg"                      alt="Conversation with Tony Stark on Character ai"                ></p><p> Although Character AI is primarily character-themed, you can still get a ChatGPT-style prompt and response interaction using the “Character Assistant” feature on the platform. Although generally impressive, don’t expect ChatGPT-quality responses. That said, Character AI is worth trying out.</p><p> Capitalizing on public interest and hunger for generative AI, startups and tech giants are scrambling to bring ChatGPT-inspired products to the market. Everyone is trying to outdo each other in this high-stakes technology arms race. The goal is simple: develop and release the most capable AI systems, or at least for now, chatbots.</p><p> As companies keep throwing money and muscle at the problem, more capable ChatGPT alternatives will emerge.
