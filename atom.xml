Rather, Apple is now moving further into AI language models. </p><p>Last Thursday, Apple released <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/apple/DCLM-7B" >DCLM-Baseline-7B <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a 7 billion parameter language model, on Hugging Face. The model is part of the DataComp for Language Models (DCLM) benchmark, an initiative to improve the quality of training datasets for language models.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-try-gpt-4o-mini-3-ways-to-access-the-smarter-cheaper-ai-model-and-2-are-free/" >Want to try GPT-4o mini? 3 ways to access the smarter, cheaper AI model - and 2 are free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>At 7 billion parameters, this model is comparable to popular models such as Llama 2, Gemma, and more. When tested on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark against popular models around the same size, DCLM-Baseline-7B performed competitively, even outperforming Mistral 7B, as seen below. </p><p>Apple&#x2F;Hugging Face</p><p>Despite its impressive performance, one of the DCLM-Baseline-7B’s biggest standouts is that the model is truly open-sourced, with “open data, open weight models, open training code,” as highlighted by Vaishaal Shankar, a research scientist at Apple. </p><blockquote><p>We have released our DCLM models on huggingface! To our knowledge these are by far the best performing truly open-source models (open data, open weight models, open training code) 1&#x2F;5</p><p>— Vaishaal Shankar (@Vaishaal) <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/Vaishaal/status/1813956553042711006?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" >July 18, 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></blockquote><p>Many are commending Apple for this approach as it allows other researchers and developers to build on the models and further grow advancements in the space. The model was trained on the <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlfoundations/dclm-baseline-1.0" >DCLM-BASELINE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> data, combined with <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/starcoderdata" >StarCoder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="http://proofpile2/" >ProofPile2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>data, to reach proficiency in other tasks such as coding and math.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-can-be-updated-to-apples-new-ios-18-public-beta-and-which-ones-cant/" >Every iPhone model that can be updated to Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones can’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In addition to releasing DCLM-Baseline-7B, model weights, training code, and dataset, Apple also included a powerful 1.4 billion parameter version in the package. </p><p>This isn’t Apple’s first go-around with AI models, having released others such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-model-can-understand-your-home-screen-and-supercharge-siri/" >Ferret-UI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a multimodal large language model (MLLM), and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-claims-its-on-device-ai-system-realm-substantially-outperforms-gpt-4/" >Reference Resolution As Language Modeling (ReALM) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a conversational AI system.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Troubleshooting-the-Most-Widespread-ChatGPT-Glitches-–-Easy-Fixes-Inside"><a href="#Troubleshooting-the-Most-Widespread-ChatGPT-Glitches-–-Easy-Fixes-Inside" class="headerlink" title="Troubleshooting the Most Widespread ChatGPT Glitches – Easy Fixes Inside"></a>Troubleshooting the Most Widespread ChatGPT Glitches – Easy Fixes Inside</h2><p> ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful chatbot with remarkable conversational abilities. However, as with any emerging technology, it often runs into problems. From login issues to unfinished responses and cryptic error messages, there are several errors that you may encounter when using this AI tool.</p><p> Whether you want to use ChatGPT occasionally or make it an integral part of your daily workflow, knowing the common errors and their fixes is crucial for maximizing ChatGPT’s potential.</p><h2 id="1-ChatGPT-Login-Error"><a href="#1-ChatGPT-Login-Error" class="headerlink" title="1. ChatGPT Login Error"></a>1. ChatGPT Login Error</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chatgpt-login-signup-page-on-smartphone-screen-feature.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt login signup page on smartphone screen feature"                ></p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-fix-chatgpt-login-error/" >ChatGPT login error <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> occurs when the chatbot doesn’t let you log into your account. There can be various reasons for this issue, but it commonly happens when you use a different sign-in method than what you originally used when creating your account.</p><p> For instance, if you signed up using your Google account, you’ll need to stick to the same method when logging in to ChatGPT. By choosing a different sign-in method, the server fails to recognize your login credentials and prevents you from engaging in conversations with the chatbot.</p><p> Some users have also reported being stuck in an endless “login loop” despite entering the right credentials. This issue usually occurs when you fail to verify your email address with OpenAI. While the login error can take several forms, the following troubleshooting tips can help you resolve all the authentication issues.</p><ul><li><strong>Verify your account:</strong> Sift through your inbox for an account verification email from OpenAI. Click the link in the email to verify your account.</li><li><strong>Double-check your account credentials for accuracy:</strong> Look for typos or mistakes in your username and password.</li><li><strong>Clear your browser cache and cookies:</strong> Browser cache and cookies store data files that can cause conflicts and prevent login attempts. Clearing cookies and your cache can eliminate these conflicts and resolve login errors.</li><li><strong>Try a different browser or device:</strong> Browser compatibility and device glitches can also prevent successful login attempts. Try an alternative browser or device to isolate the login issue.</li></ul><h2 id="2-Error-in-Body-Stream"><a href="#2-Error-in-Body-Stream" class="headerlink" title="2. Error in Body Stream"></a>2. Error in Body Stream</h2><p> The “Error in body stream” is an error message that appears when ChatGPT cannot formulate a proper response to your request. The error can occur due to poor network connection, overloaded OpenAI servers, or invalid requests. Whatever the case, you can try these<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-error-in-body-stream-issue-how-fix-it/" >troubleshooting tips to fix the body stream error <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><ul><li><strong>Regenerate the response:</strong> Clicking<strong>Regenerate response</strong> above the chat box can fix the error in the body stream. This will resend your request to ChatGPT for it to process and produce a response.</li><li><strong>Start a new chat:</strong> Another way to resolve the error is to create a new chat. Simply click<strong>New chat</strong> in the sidebar and resubmit your request.</li><li><strong>Adjust the length of your input:</strong> Long ChatGPT prompts can often result in the body stream error. Try reducing the word count of your input by splitting it into multiple queries or questions. Shortening your input makes it easier for ChatGPT to process your request and generate the desired response.</li><li><strong>Check ChatGPT’s server status:</strong> If the above fixes don’t work, you need to check the official server status of ChatGPT. If the server is down, wait for the developers to sort out the issue before you can use the tool.</li></ul><h2 id="3-Network-Error"><a href="#3-Network-Error" class="headerlink" title="3. Network Error"></a>3. Network Error</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gpt-timeout.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT timeout error"                ></p><p> The network error occurs when ChatGPT can’t connect to the server. The error message can take several forms, such as “Network Error”, “Connection timed out”, or “Cannot connect to the server”.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-chatgpt-network-error/" >ChatGPT network error <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> mostly occurs due to poor internet connectivity, a non-functioning VPN, an overloaded server, or a temporary outage at the server. Whatever the reason may be, here’s how you can get the tool up and running.</p><ul><li><strong>Check your internet connection:</strong> Having poor or no internet connection is a major reason for network errors on ChatGPT. Test your connection speed to ensure that you’re getting a stable and strong connection.</li><li><strong>Check OpenAI’s server status:</strong> If you don’t have any internet connectivity issues, the problem could be coming from OpenAI’s backend. Use an outage detector tool, such as<a class="link"   href="https://downdetector.com/" >Down Detector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , to check ChatGPT’s server status in real-time. If the server is experiencing issues, there’s nothing you can do other than wait for OpenAI’s team to fix it.</li><li><strong>Request shorter responses:</strong> The network error can also appear if you request long responses from ChatGPT or ask a query in a way that’s bound to result in excessively long responses. To prevent this, split your main query into small chunks and keep them concise.</li><li><strong>Try another browser:</strong> ChatGPT network error might be happening due to a problem with your browser. To eliminate this possibility, switch to a different browser and ask ChatGPT the same query. If you get the same error, the issue lies elsewhere.</li><li><strong>Enable or disable your VPN:</strong> A VPN connection can sometimes interfere with your internet connection and cause network issues. Disable your VPN or connect to a different server location to see if it fixes the issue.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XA_wP7rS9ww?si=LarMG3sEHAhSoL6q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Error-1020-Access-Denied-Error"><a href="#4-Error-1020-Access-Denied-Error" class="headerlink" title="4.

The site can block your IP address due to a security threat or suspicious activity.</p><p> The access denied message mostly appears when you’re using an unsecured public Wi-Fi hotspot. It can also happen due to an issue with Cloudflare’s firewall. In any case, there are a few things you can do to prevent this.</p><ul><li><strong>Use a VPN:</strong> A VPN is an online protection tool that replaces your real IP address with one of its own. So, if your original IP address is flagged by Cloudflare, you can use a VPN to change your IP address and access ChatGPT with a whitelisted IP.</li><li><strong>Use a proxy server:</strong> Similar to a VPN, a web proxy masks your IP address, so you can use it to avoid the 1020 error. However, a proxy server doesn’t encrypt your data and isn’t as reliable as a VPN.</li><li><strong>Look for a faulty browser extension:</strong> Cloudflare can also block your access to ChatGPT due to a corrupt or incompatible browser extension. An incompatible extension can interfere with Cloudflare’s firewall and leave you locked out.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HMuxjTCMX2E?si=ylRTMJuUstpjLsZc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Error-429-Too-Many-Requests"><a href="#5-Error-429-Too-Many-Requests" class="headerlink" title="5.

It’s a way for the chatbot to limit the number of requests in a given time period to maintain optimal performance without getting overloaded.</p><p>To fix error 429, consider the following tips:</p><ul><li><strong>Closely monitor your API requests:</strong> Keeping an eye on the number of requests you make in a given period will help you compress your requests and stay within<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-token-limit-can-you-exceed-it/" >ChatGPT’s token limit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li><strong>Reduce request frequency:</strong> It’s also wise to give some time between consecutive queries to make sure that you don’t exceed the server’s allowed limits.</li><li><strong>Wait and retry:</strong> The 429 error is usually a temporary issue that indicates that the server is currently overloaded with requests. Wait for a moment and resubmit your query to see if the issue is resolved.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DCARjc5g5VI?si=9OfovbKBrpoJeXTY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Unfinished-Responses"><a href="#6-Unfinished-Responses" class="headerlink" title="6.

Try the following fixes if you don’t want ChatGPT to stop mid-way:</p><ul><li><strong>Type “Continue”:</strong> In some cases, simply taping “continue generating” or typing “continue” in the message box can prompt ChatGPT to continue its response and generate a more comprehensive answer.</li><li><strong>Provide more context:</strong> ChatGPT may need more context to produce a complete response. Provide more information or specify your query to help the model understand your request and generate a complete response.</li><li><strong>Adjust the parameter settings:</strong> Modifying the temperature parameters can influence the creativity and randomness of ChatGPT.

They provide ChatGPT with additional information, such as up-to-date news or data from proprietary sources, and enable ChatGPT to perform specific actions on behalf of users.</p><p> Plugins can also help ChatGPT overcome some limitations of large language models, such as<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-hallucination-and-how-do-you-spot-it/" >AI “hallucinations” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the inability to keep up with recent events.</p><p> For example, suppose you want to use ChatGPT to write an email to your boss. You could ask ChatGPT to generate a draft for you, but it might not know the latest updates on your project or the best way to address your boss. With plugins, you could connect ChatGPT to your email client, calendar, and project management tool.</p><p> Then, ChatGPT could use these plugins to fetch relevant information and insert them into the email draft. It could also use the plugins to send emails, schedule a meeting, or update a task’s status.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JlX-G8rBs1w?si=iIhUoWAq5x3YK9rA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-You-Sign-Up-for-ChatGPT-Plugins"><a href="#How-Do-You-Sign-Up-for-ChatGPT-Plugins" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Sign Up for ChatGPT Plugins?"></a>How Do You Sign Up for ChatGPT Plugins?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-plugin-page.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt plugin page"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LT4sdZgUvRQ?si=SvQD5FouEzu4UHpJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Currently, the ChatGPT plugins feature is only available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers, and you have to join a waitlist to get access.

Plus, ChatGPT has myriad other uses, from writing professional emails and resumes to generating code or spreadsheet formulas. These amazing browser extensions augment ChatGPT’s abilities to make the AI responses and prompts better than ever.</p><p> While some of the extensions improve the ChatGPT app, others use the AI’s abilities in other webapps (such as Gmail) to improve the experience there. Do note that all but of one of these extensions require you to have a registered free account on OpenAI’s ChatGPT portal.</p><h2 id="1-WebChatGPT"><a href="#1-WebChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="1.

If you know<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/" >how ChatGPT works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll know that it isn’t scraping the internet for the latest information about any topic or news. The AI works on older data and doesn’t search the internet. WebChatGPT is an innovative workaround for this problem that adds web search results to ChatGPT.</p><p> Here’s how it works. Once you install the extension and open ChatGPT, you’ll see a bar under the usual dialog box for queries and prompts. Toggle the<strong>Search the Web</strong> button to activate WebChatGPT and select parameters. You can ask it to search for up to 10 results, set how far back it’ll search for links (day, week, month, year), and set a region.</p><p> When you give ChatGPT any prompt, it’ll conduct a web search and gather the results. Then, the extension automatically frames a revised prompt that includes those latest results and your original query, instructing ChatGPT to scan and include the results.</p><p> The final output from the AI thus gives you more up-to-date information, such as news summaries, sports statistics, weather reports and forecasts, and stock market updates.</p><p> You can customize the default revised prompt that WebChatGPT uses, but as a new user, we wouldn’t suggest that. Once you’re more accustomed to using this extension, feel free to look into options that improve your queries</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> WebChatGPT for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-advanced/lpfemeioodjbpieminkklglpmhlngfcn" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-chatgpt/" >Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ME5-sAQJVE4?si=ZfcvJSnhQevWtjI0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-ChatGPT-Prompt-Genius"><a href="#2-ChatGPT-Prompt-Genius" class="headerlink" title="2.

But those screenshots don’t show the prompts users have typed to make ChatGPT better. Like<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-google-search-tips-pdf/" >learning the best Google search operators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you need to know how to frame the right prompts for ChatGPT. And this extension can help.</p><p> ChatGPT Prompt Genius is like a cheatsheet for prompts to feed the AI. The extension gathers user-generated prompts for various functions and tasks through a<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/" >Subreddit community <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> With the extension, you can quickly run these in ChatGPT or filter them to browse through categories such as academic writing, business, learning, fun and games, fiction writing, non-fiction writing, programming, social media, speeches, scripts, etc.</p><p> The more you discover and import these prompts and customize them to your needs, the more you’ll learn how to write specific questions that ChatGPT can understand and answer.</p><p> You can curate and save your recently used prompts if you want to reuse them later. The extension lets you save entire chats with the ChatGPT AI as a PDF, PNG, or Markdown HTML file directly from the browser. You can also use custom themes for the chat interface, but that’s more about looks than function.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> ChatGPT Prompt Genius for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-history/jjdnakkfjnnbbckhifcfchagnpofjffo/" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatgpt-history/" >Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="3-ChatGPT-Writer"><a href="#3-ChatGPT-Writer" class="headerlink" title="3.

ChatGPT Writer</h2><p> When someone sends a professional email your way for something like a meeting or a job opportunity, it’s bad form to reply with a one or two-line email (even if that sums up everything you want to say). ChatGPT Writer takes your intended reply and generates a long, professional-sounding email message.</p><p> The extension works with all email services but is specially primed for Gmail, offering a button next to<strong>Send</strong> in the<strong>Compose</strong> message box. When you fire up ChatGPT Writer, you’ll see the original email and find a box to enter what you want to reply briefly.</p><p> You can make it a simple and easy command; for example, “Write a reply to this email about my interest in the job and seek information about salary.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chatgpt-writer-1.jpg"                      alt="an email reply using chatgpt writer"                ></p><p> ChatGPT Writer will take a few seconds and then compose a long, professional message along those lines. You can change or edit any words within the box, or redo your prompt if it’s not satisfactory.

Many times, all you want is a transcript to quickly browse through what the video is going to say so that you can know if it’s worth your time.</p><p> Install YouTube Summary With ChatGPT and go to any video. The right sidebar now has a box for<strong>Transcript &amp; Summary</strong> , clicking which will open a time-stamped transcript of the video generated by ChatGPT.</p><p> Click any timestamp to be taken to that moment in the video. If you’re already midway through the video, you can jump to the current time in the transcript. And you can copy-paste the transcript anywhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/youtube-summary-extension.jpg"                      alt="using the &#39;transcript and summary box&#39; from youtube summary extension"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-yZKNLxj3po?si=-RbF6nCJEVlHWP-M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The extension also has a button to view an AI-generated summary of the video.

But Google Chrome offers some excellent voice commands and text-to-speech features. Talk-to-ChatGPT bridges this gap to let you issue prompts by talking to your computer and having the ChatGPT answers read aloud by AI.</p><p> Once you install the extension, refresh the ChatGPT tab once, and press<strong>Start</strong> in the extension to allow access. A floating panel in the top-right of your screen shows whether it’s active or not, and you can toggle it to record, playback audio to read the answers or pause.</p><p> Talk-to-ChatGPT is an open-source extension that lets you fiddle around with the settings. You can choose from different AI voices, the voice pitch, and the speed at which text is read. It also supports voice command shortcuts of “Stop” and “Pause” to control playback.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Talk-to-ChatGPT for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/talk-to-chatgpt/hodadfhfagpiemkeoliaelelfbboamlk" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zmXpl6irBYk?si=BXjGpQr6PXFcqhCI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-ChatGPT-for-Search-Engines"><a href="#6-ChatGPT-for-Search-Engines" class="headerlink" title="6.

But, like anything in tech, it carries an ugly side to it, too. The rise of fake news and misinformation, for instance, is one of its biggest unwanted by-products.</p><p> Perplexity AI can help you cut the misinformation out. Indeed, as the developers put it, the tool works as a combination of Google and ChatGPT. Simply type in your query in the extension and the tool will summarize you the best possible result—along with the legitimate cited sources. The last part here is very important.</p><p> While the tool summarizes the information in a neat manner, it ends the answers with a quick mention of the best, legitimate sources. And while there’s still a possibility of fault here (you’d still need to rely on the sources that Perplexity provides), we believe it’s much better than going in blind with the usual, source-less responses you’d otherwise gotten from ChatGPT.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Perplexity AI for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perplexity-ai-companion/hlgbcneanomplepojfcnclggenpcoldo" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-Is-Awesome-But-Be-Realistic…"><a href="#ChatGPT-Is-Awesome-But-Be-Realistic…" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Is Awesome, But Be Realistic…"></a>ChatGPT Is Awesome, But Be Realistic…</h2><p> With these extensions including search results in ChatGPT, showing you how to use the right prompts, and using AI to improve YouTube or Gmail, you might think it’s time to offload a majority of your work to ChatGPT. But take a breath.</p><p> Yes, the AI capabilities are amazing compared to what has existed before this, but ChatGPT isn’t ready for prime-time yet. It still has a long way to go and depends largely upon the user keying in the right prompts. The data that it bases its answers on can also leave a lot to be desired in certain cases. For now, feel free to use it, but don’t rely wholly on it, and take those results with a pinch of salt.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-inspire-your-brand-with-smart-channel-name-genesis/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Inspire Your Brand with Smart Channel Name Genesis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/avigating-the-world-of-streamed-games/"><u>[New] Navigating the World of Streamed Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-visualizing-stories-building-animation-sets-with-movie-maker/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Visualizing Stories Building Animation Sets with Movie Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-editsuite-evaluation-detailed-article-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] EditSuite Evaluation – Detailed Article for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-reigniting-creativity-a-comprehensive-look-at-windows-10-for-editors/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Reigniting Creativity A Comprehensive Look at Windows 10 for Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/1723807876569-discover-your-running-windows-os-quick-guide-in-a-single-step/"><u>Discover Your Running Windows OS: Quick Guide in a Single Step!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/1723808028853-gaming-without-glitches-boosting-your-fps-on-destiny-2s-beyond-light/"><u>Gaming Without Glitches - Boosting Your FPS on Destiny 2'S Beyond Light.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/1723808072844-how-to-easily-rip-dvd-movies-onto-your-pc-using-windows-11/"><u>How To Easily Rip DVD Movies Onto Your PC Using Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-viral-video-legends-youtubed-for-millions/"><u>In 2024, Viral Video Legends YouTubed for Millions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/navigate-through-settings-enabledisable-video-comments/"><u>Navigate Through Settings Enable/Disable Video Comments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/steps-to-remove-a-wi-fi-connection-from-your-pc-in-windows-11/"><u>Steps to Remove a Wi-Fi Connection From Your PC in Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/swiftly-solve-your-windows-fbm-hiccups-today/"><u>Swiftly Solve Your Windows FBM Hiccups Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/the-essential-techniques-for-analyzing-drive-space-using-diskusage-commands/"><u>The Essential Techniques for Analyzing Drive Space Using DiskUsage Commands</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/tips-to-start-outlook-in-safe-mode-on-windows-11-with-pictures/"><u>Tips to Start Outlook in Safe Mode on Windows 11 [with Pictures]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/what-to-do-to-fix-pagefilesys-huge-issue/"><u>What to Do to Fix Pagefile.Sys Huge Issue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/windows-11-upgrade-procedure-a-step-by-step-tutorial-youll-love/"><u>Windows 11 Upgrade Procedure - A Step-by-Step Tutorial You'll Love</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/winning-the-battle-againnst-monitor-delays-optimizing-your-gaming-experience-on-a-dual-pc-screen-with-windows-11/"><u>Winning the Battle Againnst Monitor Delays: Optimizing Your Gaming Experience on a Dual PC Screen with Windows 11</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

No longer up for sale are the iPhone 13 and the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-pro-review/" >two Pro models of the iPhone 15 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This leaves the iPhone 14, 14 Plus, 15, 15 Plus, iPhone SE, and of course, the new iPhone 16 models as your only options should you want to <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/" >buy directly from Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-vs-iphone-16-should-you-upgrade-to-apples-latest-model/"><strong>iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 16: Should you upgrade to Apple’s latest model?</strong></a></p><p>The retirement of the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max comes as no great surprise. When Apple launched the iPhone 15 series last year, it also jettisoned the Pro models of the iPhone 14. Retiring only the Pro flavors of the previous year’s phone is an attempt by Apple to push buyers who want a Pro version to grab the latest model. That’s as true this year as it was last year.</p><p>But, the exit of the iPhone 13 marks a significant milestone for Apple’s phone lineup. The iPhone 13 was the last model to include a physical SIM. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-drops-the-sim-card-slot-heres-what-that-means/" >iPhone 14 and its predecessors are eSIM-only phones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. For me, that’s perfectly fine. I’m not a huge fan of physical SIMs.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Having to pop open the tray and then juggle that tiny card is something I can do without. Plus, switching among eSIMs when traveling to another country is a pleasure compared to swapping different physical SIMs. But I’m sure many iPhone users prefer the old-style SIMs, especially since not all countries or carriers yet support eSIMs.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/esim-vs-sim-whats-the-difference/" >eSIM vs. SIM: What’s the difference? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The iPhone 13 was also the last model to come in a mini version. Designed as an alternative to big phones, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-13-mini-lives-the-case-for-buying-it-in-2022/" >iPhone 13 mini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> sported a svelte 5.4-inch screen, ideal for people who prefer their iPhones in a small size, and with a lower price tag. Now, Apple’s only small-screened option is the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-iphone-se-2022-review/" >iPhone SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with its 4.7-inch display.</p><p>The exit of the iPhone 13, iPhone 15 Pro, and Pro Max puts potential buyers in a quandary. What should you buy if you need a new iPhone and also want it directly from Apple?</p><p>If you crave a smaller phone and budget price, the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-se&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is still a viable choice. However, with the current third-generation model launched in 2022, Apple may unveil the fourth-generation version next year. So you may want to wait to see if that product materializes.</p><p>If your budget is higher and you don’t mind an older model without the Pro features – the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-14&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would be solid choices. But keep in mind the lure of the latest features. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-delivers-on-hardware-upgrades-but-punts-apple-intelligence-rollout/" >Apple Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, for example, will be available only throughout the iPhone 16 lineup, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. If you want the new AI-powered tricks, especially the improvements headed for Siri, then one of the four iPhone 16 models is your only choice.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/"><strong>The 5 best iPhone 16 Pro features that enthusiasts will care about</strong></a></p><p>Typically, I’ve always gravitated toward the Pro models for their better displays, beefier cameras, and faster CPUs. Yet this year, the differences between the regular iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Pro&#x2F;Pro Max are less significant than in previous years. The Pro and Pro Max boast larger screen sizes and slightly better camera features, but that’s about it. So if you want the latest model but don’t want to overspend, an <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would be the way go to.</p><p>Of course, although Apple has discontinued the iPhone 13 and iPhone 15 Pro models, they’re all still readily available elsewhere. You can easily find them through third-party retailers such as Amazon, eBay, Gazelle, and other sites that sell used phones.</p><p>A few months ago, I bought a used <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-13-128GB-Midnight/dp/B09LNW3CY2/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C0c1dfd89-0dc7-4e6e-80f2-c7907e646754%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >iPhone 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> through Amazon, which I use for testing and which has performed without a hitch.

Depending on the topic, you might want to re-read the conversation, so it’s useful that ChatGPT saves and stores the previous conversations for you.</p><p> But if ChatGPT isn’t saving the chat history, you’ll have to repeat some of your prompts all over again.

Turn On the Chat History &amp; Training Data"></a>1. Turn On the Chat History &amp; Training Data</h2><p> ChatGPT will save your previous conversations by default, so you can access them anytime. Now, if you or someone else accidentally disabled the feature, ChatGPT will no longer save any new conversations and delete the chat history.</p><p> To avoid this from happening again, you should turn on the<strong>Chat history &amp; training</strong> feature.</p><p> Head to ChatGPT and click the<strong>three-dot</strong> icon next to your username, followed by<strong>Settings</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Data controls</strong> . Hit the toggle next to<strong>Chat history &amp; training</strong> so that ChatGPT will save your conversations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-history-1.jpg"                      alt="Save your conversations on ChatGPT"                ></p><p> You should know that this setting doesn’t sync across multiple devices or browsers.

If ChatGPT is working as usual, you’ll have to fix your default browser.</p><p> Try to launch ChatGPT in Incognito or Private Mode to figure out if one of the browser extensions is causing the issue. Also, you might be dealing with improper site settings.

As expected, Apple today announced a series of updates to VisionOS. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/live-updates-everything-apple-announced-at-wwdc-2024-including-ios-18-siri-ai-more/" >Everything Apple announced at WWDC 2024, including iOS 18, Siri, AI, and more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Did they improve the overall quality of life and usability of Apple’s most quixotic moonshot? I’ll tell you this: Apple only addressed two of the ten items I asked for. On the other hand, Apple did announce a bunch of additional features. I’ll discuss them here in the order Apple presented them during the keynote.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Turn-2D-images-into-spatial-photos"><a href="#1-Turn-2D-images-into-spatial-photos" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn 2D images into spatial photos"></a>1. Turn 2D images into spatial photos</h2><p>I’ve never been terribly impressed by Apple’s implementation of spatial photos, which are photos that have a 3D feel to them. The little square box and the fairly minimal lens separation of the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> resulted in something that seems more novelty than noteworthy. </p><p>Now, Apple has announced that it’s using machine learning to derive a left eye and right eye’s view of all your 2D photos, allowing you to view your flat photos as if they were 3D images. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-get-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/" >Every iPhone model that will get Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones won’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Now, here’s the thing. I tried watching a couple of Marvel 3D movies via Disney+ on the Vision Pro. All the Marvel movies were filmed in 2D and digitally remastered into 3D movies. The 3D effect is pretty underwhelming. Sometimes an object seems to be pulled from the background, but otherwise, it’s not much to write home about. </p><p>I’m guessing that Apple’s 3Difying of a 2D image will be at about the same level. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0b9szh8vEk?si=NlGzpJ6MN_SJNk5A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Watch-those-images-together-using-SharePlay-in-the-Photos-app"><a href="#2-Watch-those-images-together-using-SharePlay-in-the-Photos-app" class="headerlink" title="2. Watch those images together using SharePlay in the Photos app"></a>2. Watch those images together using SharePlay in the Photos app</h2><p>And here’s another feature that I can’t imagine any users clamoring for. Now, if you have multiple Vision Pro users, they can all see and discuss the same image together while using the Photos app. </p><p>So, yeah, if Grandma Sadie in Seattle has a Vision Pro, Cousin Marty in Miami has a Vision Pro, and you have a Vision Pro in Yuma, you can all stand around the virtual photo screen and ooh and ah over pictures of baby Alice. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMYEK2gtY5c?si=ytxNz_JHZkTrwb4b" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Gestures-for-opening-Home-View-and-Control-Center"><a href="#3-Gestures-for-opening-Home-View-and-Control-Center" class="headerlink" title="3. Gestures for opening Home View and Control Center"></a>3. Gestures for opening Home View and Control Center</h2><p>While it’s easy enough to open Vision Pro’s home view (the field of app icons) by pressing the Digital Crown on the top of the unit, getting to Control Center is a pain. VisionOS puts a tiny little arrow waaay up at the top of the viewing space, and you have to glance at it and tap your fingers together to get it to open. </p><p>In VisionOS 2, there are gestures. Holding your hand palm up and tapping fingers opens the app view. Flipping your hand over will give you time and battery level. A finger tap in this position will open up Control Center. </p><p>Unlike the previous two features, this <em>is</em> a quality of life improvement. </p><h2 id="4-Mac-virtual-display-improvements"><a href="#4-Mac-virtual-display-improvements" class="headerlink" title="4. Mac virtual display improvements"></a>4. Mac virtual display improvements</h2><p>The Mac virtual display feature of the Vision Pro has been nice, but limited. In VisionOS 1, you could only show one 4K display. Personally, I’m waiting for Apple to ditch the entire display paradigm and just show windows, but that’s not going to happen this year. </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>On the other hand, Apple “later this year” will enable you to create displays with more resolutions. The most interesting is the full wrap-around display, which will be the equivalent of two 4K monitors. </p><h2 id="5-Choo-choo-train-mode"><a href="#5-Choo-choo-train-mode" class="headerlink" title="5. Choo-choo train mode"></a>5. Choo-choo train mode</h2><p>To be fair, Apple didn’t call it that. We’ve <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/itching-to-try-vision-pros-travel-mode-heres-what-to-expect-before-you-go/" >talked about the Vision Pro’s travel mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was mostly intended for airplane travel. </p><p>In VisionOS 2, Apple is announcing that there is dedicated support in travel mode for train travel. We know <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8ckKAjAWLw8" >people have already been successful using the Vision Pro on the train and even subway <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but in this case, Apple presumably tweaked performance somewhat. </p><h2 id="6-New-developer-APIs"><a href="#6-New-developer-APIs" class="headerlink" title="6. New developer APIs"></a>6. New developer APIs</h2><p>There are a ton of VR and AR APIs in Apple’s platforms. But this week, at WWDC, Apple is showcasing three new APIs developers can use to gain access to Apple technology. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-visionos-18-things-developers-need-to-know-about-coding-for-apple-vision-pro/" >Inside VisionOS: 18 things developers need to know about coding for Apple Vision Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Volumetric API:</strong> Allows complex 3D apps to run side-by-side. A volumetric API is at the core of most 3D content, because it allows developers to create, manage, and present volumetric content. My read on this announcement is not the introduction of a Volumetric API, but that it can allow multiple 3D apps to run concurrently.</li><li><strong>TabletopKit:</strong> Helps developers create apps that anchor to flat surfaces. One obvious example is board game kits, but this could apply to interior design apps, architectural and construction projects, gaming, navigation, and more.</li><li><strong>Enterprise APIs:</strong> These were described as enterprise-specific APIs, so we can assume they’re somewhat special purpose. Examples given were surgical training and manufacturing.</li></ul><h2 id="7-New-Canon-spatial-lens-for-creating-spatial-video"><a href="#7-New-Canon-spatial-lens-for-creating-spatial-video" class="headerlink" title="7. New Canon spatial lens for creating spatial video"></a>7. New Canon spatial lens for creating spatial video</h2><p>While iPhone 15 Pro users can create spatial video, there are limitations to using an iPhone as a camera. Apple announced today that Canon will be introducing a spatial lens for its <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Canon-RF-S18-150mm-Mirrorless-Processor-Detection/dp/B0B2KSD7WW/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cbfbe271d-4f99-40f4-b81e-3b3c556a641c%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >EOS R7 digital camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>This allows more commercial and prosumer projects where the photographer or videographer needs more control over the complex range of settings available in a more traditional camera. Those videos can then be edited in Final Cut Pro, Apple’s only mention of Final Cut during WWDC. There’s also a new Vimeo app for VisionOS, that will allow spatial videos to be shared. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DJKH1uY7P0?si=tCG66XVlbwSKoATj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Third-party-immersive-video-workflow"><a href="#8-Third-party-immersive-video-workflow" class="headerlink" title="8. Third-party immersive video workflow"></a>8. Third-party immersive video workflow</h2><p>One of the truly breathtaking experiences of the Vision Pro is what Apple calls Immersive video. This is a very big step beyond the typical 3D video we’ve seen in movies and TV shows. The entire experience wraps around you 180 degrees. When it’s done right, it’s astonishing. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-watched-apples-newest-immersive-video-on-the-vision-pro-and-it-was-my-aha-moment/" >I watched Apple’s newest Immersive Video on the Vision Pro, and it was my ‘aha’ moment <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple is opening up the format for third-party creators to create immersive video. The approach is to use cameras and DaVinci Resolve Studio from <a class="link"   href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/" >Blackmagic Design <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. There’s no doubt that Blackmagic makes excellent gear and that DaVinci Resolve is a fine application. It’s just a little surprising that Apple didn’t bake this capability into its own high-end video production tool, Final Cut Pro.</p><p>Even so, I think this is great.

At the end of the Vision Pro segment, the company put up one of its feature grid graphics (shown at the beginning of this article). Here are a few that weren’t mentioned: </p><ul><li><strong>Mouse support:</strong> I mentioned this in my wishlist. Apple’s presenters didn’t mention it, but it’s on that grid of features. Hurray!</li><li><strong>Keyboard breakthrough:</strong> This was another feature I felt it was important for Apple to introduce, and apparently it will be available. No mention was made of it, so we have no idea if it’s limited solely to Apple’s own keyboards (but that’s probably the case).</li><li><strong>Bora Bora environment:</strong> I wanted to see more environments and we get…one. Personally, I think all the work on spatial photos and spatial videos could have been replaced with the ability for third parties to create 3D environments, but Apple didn’t go there. But hey, Bora Bora, right?</li><li><strong>Rearrangeable Home View:</strong> This was also not described but I’m guessing this means you can move around the Home icons.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FATJWpNYmio?si=72ugPTb3vJXz6cAM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-do-you-think"><a href="#What-do-you-think" class="headerlink" title="What do you think?"></a>What do you think?</h2><p>I’ll admit, I’m fairly underwhelmed. I definitely would have thought there would be a bunch of new environments (at least one or two indoors), as well as third-party options. </p><p>Apple did announce that more than 2,000 apps were built specifically for the Vision Pro and more than 1.5 million iPad apps are compatible. But I’m still surprised that Apple didn’t create spatial versions of its remaining non-spatial apps (i.e., Books, Calendar, Clock, Home, Maps, Podcasts, Reminders, Shortcuts, Stocks, and Voice Memos). </p><p>And, I’m shocked that Find My support is still missing from VisionOS (or at least wasn’t mentioned). </p><p>What do you think? Is VisionOS 2 enough to get us through another year of this astoundingly expensive device? Is there anything in VisionOS 2 that wasn’t in VisionOS 1 that would inspire you now to go out and buy one? If you have a Vision Pro, will any of these features improve your quality of life? Let us know in the comments below. </p><hr><p><em>You can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

From managing my inbox to coordinating my schedule and writing countless stories, notes, touching up photos, and even editing videos – I’ve done it all on the iPad. As the hardware and software have improved, the amount of work I could get done on the tablet has only increased. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-note-taking-app-for-ipad/"><strong>The best note-taking apps for iPad</strong></a></p><p>Even though it <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-decade-old-device-why-did-it-take-nine-years-for-the-ipad-to-get-its-own-operating-system/" >took nearly a decade for the iPad to get its own operating system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the key to using an iPad as a work computer has always been apps. And especially for students, there are so many different apps to choose from that will optimize your class schedule and never-ending list of tasks. </p><p>Not just apps from Apple, but third-party apps from developers who remain committed to providing high-quality tools for iPad users. In consideration of features, price, and third-party syncing, we compiled this list of the best productivity apps for iPads, with <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-calendar/id718043190" >Fantastical <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> landing on top as the best iPad app for productivity overall. We also included a handful of other apps that make using your iPad for school and work-related tasks easier. </p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-best-iPad-apps-for-productivity-in-2024"><a href="#The-best-iPad-apps-for-productivity-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="The best iPad apps for productivity in 2024"></a>The best iPad apps for productivity in 2024</h2><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical" >View now at Flexibits <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-calendar/id718043190" >View now at Apple App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Two apps in one</li><li>Combine tasks and calendar entries into one app</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>The best features are reserved for a premium account</li></ul><h2 id="Fantastical"><a href="#Fantastical" class="headerlink" title="Fantastical"></a>Fantastical</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5pwd2mwaQQ?si=qyZHgdTlbQbc32Mp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-iPad-app-for-productivity-overall"><a href="#Best-iPad-app-for-productivity-overall" class="headerlink" title="Best iPad app for productivity overall"></a>Best iPad app for productivity overall</h3><p><strong>Fantastical features:</strong> $57&#x2F;year | Calendar app | Manage your contacts</p><p>Fantastical is one of the best calendar apps available for the iPad. It combines your tasks and calendar entries into one app, and it’s easy to use thanks to features like being able to create a new entry just by typing a single line of text. For example, if you enter “Meeting with David next Thursday at 3” the appointment will be created without any further effort on your part. </p><p>You can use the app for free, with some features reserved for a premium account. </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://sparkmailapp.com/" >View now at Spark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spark-email-app-by-readdle/id1176895641" >View now at Apps.apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Various pricing tiers</li><li>Schedule or snooze an email</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>You may have to store your email account passwords on Spark’s servers which isn’t ideal</li></ul><h2 id="Spark-Mail"><a href="#Spark-Mail" class="headerlink" title="Spark Mail"></a>Spark Mail</h2><h3 id="Best-iPad-app-for-productivity-for-emails"><a href="#Best-iPad-app-for-productivity-for-emails" class="headerlink" title="Best iPad app for productivity for emails"></a>Best iPad app for productivity for emails</h3><p><strong>Spark Mail features:</strong> $60&#x2F;year for Premium Individual tier | Email templates | Snooze emails </p><p>After years of using Apple’s Mail app, I’ve finally made the switch to Readle’s Spark mail app across all of my devices. With features like the ability to schedule when an email is sent, email templates, or snooze emails for action at a later time it’s been invaluable for me. </p><p>But for business and enterprise users, there are more valuable features like the ability to create a team and work on composing emails together, with each person participating from their own devices. That subscription tier costs $84 a year. There are various pricing tiers, based on how much you plan on using the Teams feature.

I use it to sign documents, fill out forms, and open ZIP files (seriously, it’s the most reliable app for opening ZIP files I’ve used on the iPad). </p><p>If you deal with a lot of PDF files, then PDF Expert is the way to go. It’s free to download and use for basic tasks, but you’ll need a paid subscription ($80 a year or $140 for life) if you want to edit PDFs and sign documents.

Some were good, others have been great. I tried to approach this list by looking at those apps that only meet the latter requirement. Each one of these apps fits a specific role and provides a unique experience that improves upon what Apple includes in iPadOS on its own. </p><p>Here are the factors I considered: </p><p><strong>Third-party syncing:</strong> It’s important to be able to sync your work with productivity apps, so I stuck with apps that allow third-party app syncing. </p><p><strong>Productivity features:</strong> Productivity means different things to different people, so I included apps with different productivity features. Whether you’re looking to streamline your emails, optimize your calendar, or edit your text, I included a variety of apps with different productivity focuses.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Apps vary in pricing from free, subscription based, or even one-time purchases, so I included a variety of price points. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmTJlcwgyrQ?si=x3hba82M0tT57fj7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-can-an-iPad-increase-productivity"><a href="#How-can-an-iPad-increase-productivity" class="headerlink" title="How can an iPad increase productivity?"></a>How can an iPad increase productivity?</h2><p>With the addition of Apple’s M1 Processor to more recent iPad models, the iPad is arguably just about the same as a Macbook or iMac these days in terms of speed and capabilities. You can use an iPad on the go much more easily than a computer, and since the iPad is compatible with the Apple Pencil, the possibilities are endless in the amount of work and what kind of work you can do on your iPad.</p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-free-iPad-app-for-productivity"><a href="#What-is-the-best-free-iPad-app-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="What is the best free iPad app for productivity?"></a>What is the best free iPad app for productivity?</h2><p>Fantastical is the best free iPad app for productivity. Although the premium subscription will cost you $57, you can still get some great features with the free version. </p><p>PDF Expert also has a free app version for basic tasks. </p><h2 id="How-much-are-iPad-productivity-apps"><a href="#How-much-are-iPad-productivity-apps" class="headerlink" title="How much are iPad productivity apps?"></a>How much are iPad productivity apps?</h2><p>You’ll find these apps to range in pricing from free to upwards of $80 annually. Thankfully, some of these apps include family plans, where you can pay much less per month and still receive the same features–think 1Password, where a family of five can use it for under $5 per month. </p><h2 id="Are-there-alternative-productivity-apps-to-consider"><a href="#Are-there-alternative-productivity-apps-to-consider" class="headerlink" title="Are there alternative productivity apps to consider?"></a>Are there alternative productivity apps to consider?</h2><p>The App Store is full of apps geared towards productivity and making your tasks easier.

In 2023, the use of ChatGPT in crypto trading became evident, as this chatbot is a hub of information. However, there are some reasons why using ChatGPT to trade cryptocurrency may be a bad idea.</p><h2 id="1-Lack-of-Real-Time-Data"><a href="#1-Lack-of-Real-Time-Data" class="headerlink" title="1. Lack of Real-Time Data"></a>1. Lack of Real-Time Data</h2><p> The cryptocurrency market is always changing. A coin can be worth $10 on Monday and then $5 on Tuesday. Because of this, real-time data is crucial in crypto trading, be it prices, trends, or predictions. Using outdated information can result in poor investments and a loss of funds, so it’s important to be on top of things.</p><p> Because ChatGPT has only been trained with data up to September 2021, it cannot provide up-to-date information on the crypto market. Without real-time data, it becomes almost impossible to make a wise crypto trading decision, so it’s best not to rely on ChatGPT entirely here.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OdlXe5RELW0?si=Iz1H1QnLQVw-Eu3e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-AI-Hallucinations-and-Potential-Biases"><a href="#2-AI-Hallucinations-and-Potential-Biases" class="headerlink" title="2.

In other words, it does not provide the expected response. This can happen in a number of scenarios and is possible in ChatGPT.</p><p> For instance, you may give ChatGPT unrealistic prompts that it cannot fulfill. At this point, the chatbot may give you an untrue answer simply to satisfy your query as best it can. The chatbot doesn’t know it’s lying but thinks the information it’s giving you is appropriate, despite that not being the case.</p><p> If ChatGPT hallucinates when you’re trying to reach a crypto trading or investment decision, and ChatGPT hallucinates, you could make a poor decision and lose money.</p><p> If you’re worried about AI hallucination, there are some<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/prevent-ai-hallucination/" >things you can do it avoid it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Additionally, ChatGPT can fall victim to biases, which can affect the accuracy of its response. Sample bias, political bias, courtesy bias, and ignorance bias have all been identified as a possibility when using ChatGPT, which could be bad news for crypto traders.</p><p> ChatGPT can hold a bias in certain scenarios due to its training data. According to<a class="link"   href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/gpt-3/" >BBC Science Focus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , ChatGPT was fed with an incredible 570GB of data from various sources, including books, journals, news articles, and Wikipedia. Most of this information was written by humans who hold biases, conscious or not. Even if less than 1% of ChatGPT’s training data is biased, that still poses a problem.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_dOmuXhsV6Y?si=aT6vgPbDx4ajjvdr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Fails-to-Give-Personalized-Financial-Advice"><a href="#3-Fails-to-Give-Personalized-Financial-Advice" class="headerlink" title="3.

But while this is possible, it may not be the best route to pursue.</p><p> ChatGPT knows more than any one human could ever know. But ChatGPT wasn’t specifically designed to provide financial advice. ChatGPT is a jack-of-all-trades chatbot, meaning it can answer questions on almost any topic. But this also means the tool is not fully equipped for hyper-specific or niche prompts.</p><p> Because ChatGPT knows nothing about your financial circumstances, delivering personalized financial advice is tough. How much you have to spend, your preferred platforms, your spending habits, how much you can afford to lose, and the profit you’re looking to make must all be considered, and this may end up being too much for ChatGPT.</p><p> This may result in the chatbot telling you it cannot satisfy your request or in AI hallucination, leading to an inaccurate response.</p><h2 id="4-Relies-Heavily-on-Historical-Data"><a href="#4-Relies-Heavily-on-Historical-Data" class="headerlink" title="4.

What ChatGPT can do is interpret what you’re saying and provide you with an interpretable response using its training data.</p><p> ChatGPT can be friendly and<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/can-ai-make-us-laugh/" >even make jokes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but this is all based on the data it has been trained with. You could certainly call it a smart program, as it is highly advanced by today’s standards, but it is not an all-knowing entity.</p><p> It’s very important to remember this, as it’s easy to assume you’re getting crypto advice and statistics from a genius-level AI system when that isn’t the case. You should never use ChatGPT as a substitute for professional financial advice or up-to-date sources because of this heavy reliance on historical data.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ECz3oZ8NrQ?si=86vkwkDJo9HQXpzt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Lacks-Insights-Into-Macroeconomic-Factors"><a href="#5-Lacks-Insights-Into-Macroeconomic-Factors" class="headerlink" title="5. Lacks Insights Into Macroeconomic Factors"></a>5. Lacks Insights Into Macroeconomic Factors</h2><p> The crypto market is tied to the traditional market in ways you’d never expect. If something big goes wrong in the traditional financial industry, chances are the ripples will be felt by the crypto industry. After all, people use traditional money to buy crypto, so it’s natural for the two markets to interlink.</p><p> But this evident relationship means that macroeconomic factors should be considered when making a crypto investment or trading decision. For instance, you should consider your residential country’s inflation and interest rates before delving into crypto, as an oncoming market hiccup, or even a crash, may cause a coin’s demand to plummet.</p><p> Say you bought a single crypto coin for $100 on Monday. The next day, your government announces a rise in interest rates. This means that anyone borrowing money is worse off, and may lead to people selling off their crypto to have more fiat currency. If thousands of people offload their holding of the crypto you invested in on Monday, its demand will plummet.</p><p> Once supply exceeds demand, prices drop. Now, the coin you bought is only worth $70. The next day, it may be worth less, and this is all because of a traditional market issue.</p><p> Because ChatGPT doesn’t have access to real-time data, it cannot consider these kinds of macroeconomics when giving investment and trading advice. Nine out of ten times, this may not matter, but there’s always a chance of receiving advice from ChatGPT when the tool itself hasn’t considered all the necessary factors in its response.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Iv3DjT2Fyw?si=pR_z8ZDDVGF2MvKJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT-Is-Revolutionary-but-Far-From-Perfect"><a href="#ChatGPT-Is-Revolutionary-but-Far-From-Perfect" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Is Revolutionary but Far From Perfect"></a>ChatGPT Is Revolutionary but Far From Perfect</h2><p> There’s no denying that ChatGPT can help you in a myriad of ways, be it in research, writing, idea generation, or creativity.

Its capabilities are optimized for rapidly fetching relevant and accurate search results without compromising user safety.</p><p> The Prometheus model powers the new Bing to deliver summarized search results that are more relevant and can even answer composite search queries.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOyLy8DeizY?si=GkAmK0hChZw6_2tW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="A-New-Generation-of-AI-for-Web-Searching"><a href="#A-New-Generation-of-AI-for-Web-Searching" class="headerlink" title="A New Generation of AI for Web Searching"></a>A New Generation of AI for Web Searching</h2><p> As a result of Bing’s AI transition, web searching will fundamentally change. In the near future, we won’t have to explore a list of potentially relevant results aimlessly. Instead, AI chatbots will give us the precise information we need to be styled in a format of your choosing.</p><p> For instance, if you had to do homework for Science class, you’d typically end up querying Google for information related to your topic. The search engine would then return you a list of sites it thinks are relevant to your specific search query, and finally, you’d explore some of the top-ranked sites to get accurate and relevant information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/best-google-fi-phones.jpg"                      alt="Google app on the home screen of a smartphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVsiIO7hWOc?si=UvWnqxaI_yHwEr74" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> On the AI-powered Bing, you can specifically query it to give you a list of important points related to your Science class, and Bing will provide you with precisely that. You won’t have to explore multiple retrieved search results. Instead, you can rest assured that Bing has all the correct answers you need, thanks to its AI-powered search algorithm.</p><p> You can also use Bing as your AI chatbot and query it for simple questions like “What’s the weather going to be like in two weeks?” and even complex queries such as “I enjoyed Coachella, what similar music festivals should I visit?”. If you’re not satisfied with Bing’s answer, you can ask it to refine the response per your needs.</p><h2 id="A-New-Era-for-Web-Browsers-as-Well"><a href="#A-New-Era-for-Web-Browsers-as-Well" class="headerlink" title="A New Era for Web Browsers as Well?"></a>A New Era for Web Browsers as Well?</h2><p> Web browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are used to surf the web. They allow you to access webpages on the internet, view multimedia content on sites such as YouTube and Netflix, access your email inbox, play games, and more. With all the AI advancements in the web domain, it’s crucial to consider the impact it could have on web browsers and how we access the web.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/fa206782af9b714e31a62f7ae5d0a20ed9b7932652ed0826ec0104cd05df9774.jpg"                      alt="Icons of multiple web browsers on a wooden board background"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l-SCWTWpegY?si=oxTsHQkIu1v4-I6b" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> While we’re certainly still a long way from seeing web browsers go obsolete, but we can expect functional upgrades that make it easy to access AI-powered web searching and content generation. Perhaps other browsers, such as Chrome and Opera, will adopt something similar to Edge’s new AI sidebar.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/google-launching-bard-ai-compete-with-chatgpt/" >Google is expected to release its Bard competitor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to Microsoft’s AI-powered Bing very soon.

If you want accurate, useful information from an AI chatbot, crafting a prompt properly is important.</p><p> But it’s not always easy. How specific should you be? What information should you include? And how do you request your data in a useful format?</p><p> A whole new world of prompt engineering is springing into life, all dedicated to crafting and perfecting the art of AI prompting. But you can skip the tricky bits and improve your AI prompting game with these tips and tricks.</p><h2 id="1-Be-as-Specific-as-Possible"><a href="#1-Be-as-Specific-as-Possible" class="headerlink" title="1 Be as Specific as Possible"></a>1 Be as Specific as Possible</h2><p> One<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-prompt-mistakes-to-avoid/" >ChatGPT prompt mistake <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is not being specific with the information you give, and this is also a problem when using Microsoft Copilot and other AI tools. If you want AI to provide more accurate results, you need to tell it exactly what you’re looking for.p</p><p> For example, let’s say that you want your AI tool to generate a new gym workout plan. If you simply say something like, “Please create a gym plan for five days per week,” you’ll get generic results. Instead, a better prompt is:</p><blockquote><p>“Please create a fitness and diet plan that involves five workouts per week. I want to combine weightlifting with high-intensity interval training and have been regularly exercising for 10 years. I’m 28 years old, 6 ft, and 90 kilograms. I don’t have any allergies, but I am sensitive to rice and don’t want to drink alcohol.”</p></blockquote><p> As you can see below, we’ve received more of a customized workout plan with the types of exercises that we wanted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-12-59-46.png"                      alt="A gym routine generated with ChatGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uSfA74aeYeA?si=HdJSMdeS7HVtS6-j" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The more context you provide your AI tool, the better of a response you’ll receive.</p><h2 id="2-Ask-for-More-Information-After-Getting-an-Initial-Answer"><a href="#2-Ask-for-More-Information-After-Getting-an-Initial-Answer" class="headerlink" title="2 Ask for More Information After Getting an Initial Answer"></a>2 Ask for More Information After Getting an Initial Answer</h2><p> As you use tools like ChatGPT more frequently, you’ll quickly learn that the first answer you get shouldn’t always be taken as is. In the same way that you’d ask a person further questions to get more information out of them, you should do the same when prompting with AI.</p><p> This time, we’ve asked our AI tool to give us a three-day San Francisco itinerary for a couple’s trip. Using the first tip mentioned in this guide and being more specific, we got a pretty good outline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-13-06-24.png"                      alt="An itinerary generated with ChatGPT"                ></p><p> However, I wanted to get further information that wasn’t included. So, I asked for hotel recommendations within a customized budget:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-13-11-12.png"                      alt="An expanded answer with ChatGPT"                ></p><p> As a general rule of thumb, ask as many questions as you feel necessary to get all the information you’re looking for. You may also want to determine<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/should-you-buy-ai-prompts/" >whether premium AI prompts are worth the money <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="3-Explain-What-Hasn’t-Worked-When-You’ve-Prompted-in-the-Past"><a href="#3-Explain-What-Hasn’t-Worked-When-You’ve-Prompted-in-the-Past" class="headerlink" title="3 Explain What Hasn’t Worked When You’ve Prompted in the Past"></a>3 Explain What Hasn’t Worked When You’ve Prompted in the Past</h2><p> As you use AI prompting more frequently, you’ll get a better idea of what does and doesn’t work for you. You’ll also learn which prompts are useful and which ones confuse the tool that you’re using. Once you’ve become more familiar with AI, make sure that you clearly outline what hasn’t worked before.</p><p> This tip is especially important if you want to use AI tools like DALL-E 3 to generate images. I’ve often noticed that first drafts sometimes don’t yield what I’m looking for, and there could also be problems like defects for items like flags.</p><p> Besides mentioning what hasn’t worked for you when prompting in the past, you may also wish to outline anything that has not worked with what you’re trying to do. For example, if you’re putting together a new workout regimen, you may want to talk about which foods you’ve noticed you have a negative reaction to before.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZVDkvMZvP4?si=xAugrCf-Ud6EMMpm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Don’t-Make-Your-AI-Multitask"><a href="#4-Don’t-Make-Your-AI-Multitask" class="headerlink" title="4 Don’t Make Your AI Multitask"></a>4 Don’t Make Your AI Multitask</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/7dd47039b908f15adfac56204ff22ad7becb8a002a35f04201c966ce7066b460.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt logo and message on smartphone feature"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaqfZcWg5sE?si=LPmSKk7AFp8VxDFD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Ascannio&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/chatgpt-chat-bot-screen-seen-on-2237655785" >Shutterstock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/mistakes-generative-ai-tools/" >Avoiding common mistakes when using AI prompting tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> isn’t always easy, but one of the main issues you’ll encounter is trying to make the tool multitask. AI programs will often generate your results within a few minutes, but they can only do one thing at a time. If you try to ask too many things in one go, you won’t get the results you want.</p><p> Sometimes, you’ll begin a prompt and realize you forgot to add further information. When this happens, stop or edit the current prompt and include those details before re-generating your answer.</p><p> Once you’ve received one prompt’s results, you can move on to the next one until you’re happy with everything. Doing things this way might seem more time-consuming, but<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/master-single-tasking-using-technology-improve-productivity/" >single-tasking often improves productivity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it’s the same for your AI, too.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r_wWybMqZEM?si=0nPjCQDLS2MCaQbG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Tell-Your-AI-Tool-What-You-Don’t-Want-in-Your-Answer"><a href="#5-Tell-Your-AI-Tool-What-You-Don’t-Want-in-Your-Answer" class="headerlink" title="5 Tell Your AI Tool What You Don’t Want in Your Answer"></a>5 Tell Your AI Tool What You Don’t Want in Your Answer</h2><p> Do you remember in our first point when we told you to be as specific as possible? This also means you should let your AI tool know what you don’t want in your answers. While generative AI can produce some pretty cool results, it can’t guess everything for you.</p><p> When designing your prompt, be very specific about what you don’t want in your results. For example, if you’re planning a trip, you may want to mention that you don’t want to join tours or would prefer to avoid popular spots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-13-38-46.png"                      alt="Answer options from ChatGPT, based on what the user did and didn&#39;t want "                ></p><p> Sometimes, your AI tool will give you multiple options in your answers. You can then choose whichever one works best for you.</p><h2 id="6-Upload-Images-or-Files-if-Available"><a href="#6-Upload-Images-or-Files-if-Available" class="headerlink" title="6 Upload Images or Files (if Available)"></a>6 Upload Images or Files (if Available)</h2><p> Uploading images or files will often make your AI prompts much more effective. For example, if you want to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/create-one-page-resume/" >create a one-page resume with AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it’s worth uploading an existing PDF and getting feedback. You can use several plugins to get better responses, especially if you use ChatGPT. One example is<a class="link"   href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-MrgKnTZbc-resume" >Resume by jobbright.ai <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> If you’re using AI to create art, it’s also a good idea to upload images that the AI tool can use as examples. Meanwhile, if you want to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-photo-ai/" >use Photo AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or similar tools for pictures of yourself, uploading selfies, headshots, and other images will help you achieve what you want.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-tools-answer-pdf/" >Some AI tools can even answer questions from your PDFs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to get more clarity.</p><h2 id="7-Mention-Where-You-Want-to-Use-Your-Prompt-Answers"><a href="#7-Mention-Where-You-Want-to-Use-Your-Prompt-Answers" class="headerlink" title="7 Mention Where You Want to Use Your Prompt Answers"></a>7 Mention Where You Want to Use Your Prompt Answers</h2><p> Sometimes, the results your AI prompts generate won’t be useful for the place you want to use them. For example, if you want to create a post for Instagram, you probably don’t want your tool to provide huge bodies of text. On the other hand, you might want something more formal if you’re going to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/linkedin-how-to-improve-profile-with-ai/" >improve your LinkedIn profile with AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> If you use the information from your AI prompt online, it’s worth specifically mentioning where you’ll use it. That way, you won’t need to edit your results as much.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-13-54-04.png"                      alt="A LinkedIn post generated with ChatGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfEPmG_O6F8?si=93ZTVtH_zjFRz5eh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> AI prompting takes some time to become competent with, and you’ll need to adjust how you type depending on the tool you use and the information you wish to extract. The good news, however, is that you normally only need small tweaks to make your prompts deliver better results. Having read this guide, you should now be in a much better place to prompt more efficiently.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-visionary-backdrop-transformers-photorealm-innovation/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Visionary Backdrop Transformers PhotoRealm Innovation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-invisible-viewers-for-fb-chronicles-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Invisible Viewers for FB Chronicles for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-rankings.techidaily.com/1-seamless-steps-preserving-your-iphone-conversations-with-5-simple-archiving-techniques/"><u>1.

The app uses GPT-4 and is built purely to analyze documents to give answers only from the material given to that bot.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Discover-the-Ultimate-9-Chatbot-Plug-Ins-for-Seamless-ChatGPT-Integration-Today"><a href="#Discover-the-Ultimate-9-Chatbot-Plug-Ins-for-Seamless-ChatGPT-Integration-Today" class="headerlink" title="Discover the Ultimate 9 Chatbot Plug-Ins for Seamless ChatGPT Integration Today"></a>Discover the Ultimate 9 Chatbot Plug-Ins for Seamless ChatGPT Integration Today</h2><p> Following the release of GPT-4, OpenAI launched ChatGPT plugins, a new way to extend the abilities of the AI chatbot. Available exclusively to ChatGPT Plus subscribers, around 85 plugins were available at launch. But that number has since grown to hundreds of options. Unfortunately, a huge number of these plugins do not really do anything remarkable.</p><p> On March 19, 2024,<a class="link"   href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8988022-winding-down-the-chatgpt-plugins-beta" >OpenAI disabled ChatGPT Plugin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> conversations and finally completely removed them on April 9, 2024. ChatGPT Plugins were removed because much of their functionality can be found in<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-custom-gpt-store/" >custom GPTs and the GPT Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="1-Prompt-Perfect"><a href="#1-Prompt-Perfect" class="headerlink" title="1. Prompt Perfect"></a>1. Prompt Perfect</h2><p> The responses you get from the ChatGPT are only as good as the prompts you provide. But prompting can be tricky–it’s a game of hits and misses. Prompt Perfect is a ChatGPT plugin that helps you<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/write-effective-chatgpt-prompts-for-ai-answers/" >craft well-structured and effective prompts that will get you the results you want <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> To invoke the Prompt Perfect plugin, you’ll need to start your prompt with “Perfect,” followed by the prompt you have in mind. The plugin will then replace your prompt with an optimized version, typically more detailed, ensuring you<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/prompting-techniques-to-improve-chatgpt-responses/" >get the best responses from ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> In the example below, we asked ChatGPT to “write a funny story about the history of car seatbelts.” The plugin immediately kicks in and replaces the prompt with a more descriptive prompt that produces a better response.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-prompt-perfect-plugin-in-action.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Prompt perfect plugin in action"                ></p><h2 id="2-Link-Reader"><a href="#2-Link-Reader" class="headerlink" title="2. Link Reader"></a>2. Link Reader</h2><p> Another useful ChatGPT plugin is the aptly named Link Reader plugin. Although its primary function is reading the content of the links you provide, when paired with other ChatGPT plugins, there’s a lot you can do with it. From summarizing the content of web pages to fact-checking news, the possibilities are endless.</p><p> In the example below, we paired the Link Reader plugin with ChatGPT’s inbuilt browsing feature to fact-check a news article.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fact-checking-with-link-reader-plugin.jpg"                      alt="fact checking with link reader plugin"                ></p><h2 id="3-InstaCart"><a href="#3-InstaCart" class="headerlink" title="3. InstaCart"></a>3. InstaCart</h2><p> The InstaCart ChatGPT plugin helps you express your meal planning needs in natural language and, in turn, get a “shoppable” list of the food items or ingredients that you need to prepare the meal in an instant. The plugin generates an InstaCart shopping list of all the ingredients you’ll need to prepare a meal in its right quantity. With a few further clicks, you can get all the ingredients delivered to your doorstep.</p><p> It is quite powerful, flexible, and easy to use. Once you mention plans to cook or prepare a meal in your prompt, the plugin will likely kick in. If it doesn’t, you can explicitly ask ChatGPT to use it.</p><p> In the illustration below, we prompted ChatGPT with some ingredients we had. Then, we asked it what meal we could cook with them. After suggesting we cook Jollof rice, ChatGPT listed the additional ingredients we’ll need and asked whether to generate an InstaCart shopping list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instacart-and-chatgpt-in-action.jpg"                      alt="InstaCart and ChatGPT in action"                ></p><p> When we replied “yes,” InstaCart generated a link to a shopping list of the remaining ingredient we’ll need to cook Jollof rice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jollof-rice-shopping-list-by-instacart-chatgpt-plugin.jpg"                      alt="Jollof Rice shopping list by InstaCart ChatGPT plugin"                ></p><p> After we made a few adjustments, all the necessary ingredients were added to our shopping cart awaiting checkout.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instarcart-plugin-in-action.jpg"                      alt="InstarCart Plugin in action"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpnYKIrpgZQ?si=94zicAHp1CH-0oso" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Wolfram"><a href="#4-Wolfram" class="headerlink" title="4. Wolfram"></a>4. Wolfram</h2><p> Although a lot of the ChatGPT plugins offer minimal improvements to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >ChatGPT’s capabilities <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Wolfram is a standout option. The Wolfram plugin substantially augments ChatGPT’s abilities. It makes ChatGPT significantly smarter by giving it access to real-time data, improved mathematical abilities, and a large dataset of carefully curated, and largely verified data.</p><p> While ChatGPT has had<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-hallucination-and-how-do-you-spot-it/" >AI hallucination <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , inaccurate responses, and slip-ups in mathematical calculations, Wolfram helps ChatGPT overcome some of those problems. So, when using ChatGPT to produce content that involves calculations or needs to be as factual as possible, Wolfram comes in quite handy. One of our favorite, although unconventional use cases for Wolfram are for fact-checking ChatGPT-generated information because of its superior fact-based dataset.</p><p> In this illustration, we asked ChatGPT to generate data about the planet Pluto. (This contains both factual and incorrect information)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/facts-about-pluto-generated-by-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="facts about Pluto generated by ChatGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9sk53d1bBhY?si=yaTeDogLb3D4dYu1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> We then invoked the Wolfram plugin to fact-check the information using its fact-based knowledge base. And here’s the result.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fact-checking-with-chatgpt-and-wolfram-alpha.jpg"                      alt="fact-checking with ChatGPT and Wolfram Alpha"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GyfJUhsz_AY?si=x2HjoLX1B89oEPgZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Wolfram was able to run the generated information against its database to check for accuracy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNhKhWc0wLc?si=1XLYV0sXV52Xc0lu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-ChatWithPDF"><a href="#5-ChatWithPDF" class="headerlink" title="5. ChatWithPDF"></a>5. ChatWithPDF</h2><p> The ChatWithPDF plugin does exactly what the name suggests. With this handy tool, you can effortlessly<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-read-pdf-ways/" >use ChatGPT to extract information from any PDF file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by simply providing a link to it. No additional steps are required—just share the PDF link in your prompt and begin asking your questions.</p><p> There are dozens of possible use cases. You can upload your class lessons as a PDF and use it to prepare for exams, upload work documents and use it to prepare reports for work, or simply prompt the tool to extract the key points from any PDF. Here’s a sample prompt for invoking the plugin:</p><p>Does GPT-4 have visual input abilities? Use the PDF at the URL “<a class="link"   href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf" >https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ as your knowledge base.</p><p> We provided a link to OpenAI’s GPT-4 technical report and asked it about the model’s visual input abilities. Here’s what it had to say:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gpt-4-visual-input-abilities.jpg"                      alt="GPT-4 visual input abilities"                ></p><p> Turns out another important use case is making sense of technical documents like this.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w7c5EHp-GDw?si=UTw7lZR0wTmRjp8W" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Video-Insights"><a href="#6-Video-Insights" class="headerlink" title="6. Video Insights"></a>6. Video Insights</h2><p> The Video Insights plugin is a video interfacing tool that lets you extract information from videos hosted on platforms like YouTube and Daily Motion. You can use the tool to create summaries of a video, ask specific questions on topics covered in the video, get a complete transcript of the video, or extract metadata like the number of likes, views, or comments on a video. Be careful with trusting the metadata it extracts; it was wrong eight out of 15 times when we tried it. But the summaries it produces are quite spot on. To use the tool, use a prompt like:</p><p>What’s the YouTube video at this URL (<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFvXuyITwBI" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFvXuyITwBI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) about?</p><p> We tried the tool on a first-impression video of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-vision-pro-headset-explained/" >Apple’s Vision Pro VR headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on YouTube, and here’s what it had to say:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/videoinsights-plugin-in-action.jpg"                      alt="VideoInsights Plugin in action"                ></p><p>Yes, it was a spot-on description of the video if you’re wondering.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZVDkvMZvP4?si=xAugrCf-Ud6EMMpm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-SceneXplain"><a href="#7-SceneXplain" class="headerlink" title="7. SceneXplain"></a>7. SceneXplain</h2><p> SceneXplain is a hidden gem we found tucked away in the ChatGPT plugin store. What does it do? It takes an image URL as input and returns a detailed description of the image. It is quite impressive in describing complex scenes with multiple people and objects. When we tried it, its descriptions of 12 of the 14 images we tried were spot on, although it can be a bit overly artistic or dramatic in its choice of words. On its own, SceneXplain might not have a lot of use cases. But when combined with other tools, it comes quite handy.</p><p> We drew an image of a web page layout and asked ChatGPT to create an HTML and CSS code that replicates the layout by invoking SceneXplain. The results weren’t too far off the mark.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/scenexplain-plugin-in-action.jpg"                      alt="SceneXplain plugin in action"                ></p><p>To use the plugin, use a prompt like:</p><p>Explain this image: <a class="link"   href="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7876708/pexels-photo-7876708.jpeg" >https://images.pexels.com/photos/7876708/pexels-photo-7876708.jpeg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or list all the objects you see in this image: <a class="link"   href="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7876708/pexels-photo-7876708.jpeg" >https://images.pexels.com/photos/7876708/pexels-photo-7876708.jpeg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="8-There’s-An-AI-For-That"><a href="#8-There’s-An-AI-For-That" class="headerlink" title="8. There’s An AI For That"></a>8. There’s An AI For That</h2><p> “There’s An AI For That” isn’t the most glamorous of plugins on the ChatGPT plugins store, but we found it quite useful. The tool provides you with a curated list of AI tools that can do any tasks you describe. Sure, you have the option of going into a long, endless round of Google searches that might not get you what you want. But you can simply let the specialized tool do the job of highlighting AI tools for whichever tasks you wish to complete. In an era where AI is at the forefront of most things in the tech space, “There’s An AI For That” can come in quite handy.</p><p> In the example below, we prompted ChatGPT to suggest some AI tools we can use to manipulate pictures into a music video. Some of it turned out to be a revelation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/there-is-an-ai-for-that-chatgpt-plugin.jpg"                      alt="There is an AI for that ChatGPT plugin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZTlPdOFNmo?si=Ym8p7ayV1gtNzzXj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="9-What-to-Watch"><a href="#9-What-to-Watch" class="headerlink" title="9. What to Watch"></a>9. What to Watch</h2><p> If you are a fan of movies and TV shows, then the “What to Watch” plugin is one worth installing. Describe the kind of movies or TV shows you want, and it will bring up plausible suggestions. Unfortunately, one major setback is that it isn’t hooked up to an updated movie database. When we prompted it for new movies, it failed to turn up any movie released after 2021.</p><p> If your prompting skills aren’t particularly strong, you’ll find it useful. However, if you know your way around ChatGPT prompts, you might be better off using your own ChatGPT prompts, in which case we recommend checking out our comprehensive<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-movie-shows-recommendations/" >guide on using ChatGPT to decide what to watch next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Embrace-ChatGPT-Plugins"><a href="#Embrace-ChatGPT-Plugins" class="headerlink" title="Embrace ChatGPT Plugins"></a>Embrace ChatGPT Plugins</h2><p> If you’ve had an underwhelming experience with ChatGPT plugins, you’re not alone. However, you’ll find a number of useful ChatGPT plugins that extend the chatbot’s abilities if you look closely enough. While the plugin store is not as loaded with high-quality plugins as we’d hoped to see, take advantage of the available ones to make the best of your ChatGPT experience.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-in-depth-analysis-ultimate-storage-choices/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved In-Depth Analysis Ultimate Storage Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-blending-iphone-videos-a-simple-guide/"><u>[New] Blending iPhone Videos A Simple Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-troubleshooting-tips-fixing-srt-from-premiere-freeze-for-2024/"><u>[New] Troubleshooting Tips Fixing SRT From Premiere Freeze for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-enhancing-beauty-on-streams-via-color-grading/"><u>2024 Approved Enhancing Beauty on Streams via Color Grading</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/2024-approved-iphone-expertise-crafting-time-lapse-photos/"><u>2024 Approved IPhone Expertise Crafting Time-Lapse Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/can-you-rely-on-chatgpts-responses-truthfulness-assessment/"><u>Can You Rely on ChatGPT's Responses - Truthfulness Assessment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/decoding-googles-innovative-ai-the-revolutionary-large-scale-palm-2-system/"><u>Decoding Google’s Innovative AI: The Revolutionary Large-Scale PaLM 2 System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/discovering-the-power-of-claude-understanding-its-benefits-and-uses/"><u>Discovering the Power of Claude: Understanding Its Benefits and Uses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/does-itools-virtual-location-not-work-on-apple-iphone-14-plusipad-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Does iTools virtual location not work On Apple iPhone 14 Plus/iPad? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/eco-friendly-energy-how-mushroom-chip-technology-is-revolutionizing-gadget-charge-and-sustainability-zdnet/"><u>Eco-Friendly Energy: How Mushroom Chip Technology Is Revolutionizing Gadget Charge & Sustainability - ZDNet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/exploring-enhanced-functionalities-in-the-chatgpt-desktop-versus-web-platforms/"><u>Exploring Enhanced Functionalities in the ChatGPT Desktop Versus Web Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/forgot-pattern-lock-heres-how-you-can-unlock-oneplus-nord-n30-5g-pattern-lock-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>Forgot Pattern Lock?

It’s truly a slightly less expensive iPad Pro that’s only missing a few features (primarily an upgraded processor, an even better display, and more powerful cameras for AR and pro video capture). </p><p>This is the iPad to get if you want to use your iPad nearly every day and do more than just read and watch videos. You want to use it to answer emails, write up documents, take notes, draw a little bit, and maybe play games, for example. The iPad Air is much more powerful device than the base-level iPad, and it’s meant for doing more.

By the time you do all that, it’s going to cost you $1,300. That’s only $200 less than a similarly configured 11-inch iPad Pro.

This unequivocally makes the iPad 10th-gen the best iPad for FaceTime calls, Zoom meetings, and other types of video calls. And, based on customer reviews, this iPad would be a good option for those new to Apple as well as those looking for something easy to use for kids or seniors.</p><p>The biggest drawback to this model is the price.

And it starts at $329, which makes it very accessible. It’s a great first iPad for kids. It’s also a good one to give elderly relatives and friends who are still a little uncomfortable with technology and just need a device to do a few simple things. </p><p>The 9th-gen iPad is filled with last-generation technology such as the Lightning connector for charging, a Touch ID home button, 4G LTE connectivity, the A13 chip, and the 1st-gen Apple Pencil. But it does have a 12MP front-facing camera and so it’s still a good video call device. And overall, these older technologies are still good enough to handle the basics for most people – and will be for several years to come. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-ipad-2021/"><strong>Apple iPad (2021) review: If it’s not broke, don’t fix it</strong></a></p><p>And the customer reviews speak for themselves: 98% of customers who have purchased this generation iPad at Best Buy would recommend it to a friend, and gave it a rating of 4.9 stars out of 5.</p><p><strong>iPad (9th generation) t</strong> <strong>ech specs: Display</strong>: 10.2-inch Retina display | <strong>Processor</strong>: A13 Bionic | <strong>Storage</strong>: 64GB or 256GB | <strong>Biometrics</strong>: Touch ID | <strong>Colors</strong>: Silver, space gray | <strong>Cameras</strong>: 8MP rear, 1080p video, 12MP FaceTime camera with Center Stage | <strong>Weight</strong>: 1.07 pounds | <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 9.8 x 6.8 x 0.29 inches | <strong>Connections</strong>: 3.5mm headphone jack, Lightning port | <strong>Battery life:</strong> 10 hours</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro/12.9-inch-display-128gb-space-gray-wifi&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-latest-model-with-wi-fi-512gb-space-gray/5499401.p?skuId=5499401&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-9041660-15733793?url=https://www.verizon.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-12-9-inch-6th-generation/?sku=sku5710003&sid=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Verizon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Gorgeous display with Retina XDR and ProMotion</li><li>Has M2, most powerful chip in an iPad</li><li>Wi-Fi 6E for faster connectivity</li><li>Advanced camera system for AR and pro video capture</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Costs as much as a powerful laptop</li><li>Camera placement is awkward for video calls</li><li>Heavy when combined with Magic Keyboard</li></ul><h2 id="iPad-Pro-6th-generation"><a href="#iPad-Pro-6th-generation" class="headerlink" title="iPad Pro (6th generation)"></a>iPad Pro (6th generation)</h2><h3 id="Best-iPad-money-can-buy"><a href="#Best-iPad-money-can-buy" class="headerlink" title="Best iPad money can buy"></a>Best iPad money can buy</h3><p>The iPad Pro is the ultimate iPad, where Apple has pushed the boundaries of what’s possible for a tablet and even tempted people to make this their only computing device. Customers who have bought it praise this processor upgrade, saying it makes the iPad Pro “future-proof” and worth the cost in the long run. But I would argue that most people shouldn’t buy the iPad Pro thinking it’s a replacement for your laptop, because many of you would be disappointed and frustrated.</p><p>Instead, you should buy the iPad Pro for the things it does well that you can’t do with a laptop.

Being able fire up the iPad Pro with its excellent keyboard, beautiful screen, and faster processor and power through messages and documents from anywhere is truly a treat. And for professionals who want the flexibility of drawing with a digital device or working with AR for viewing and capturing high-quality video without a heavy, bulky rig, the iPad Pro is a purpose-built device that works great. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pro-2022-review-im-cautiously-optimistic-or-foolish/"><strong>iPad Pro (2022): I’m cautiously optimistic.

There almost always ends up being a task that’s more frustrating or takes extra steps or simply doesn’t have all of the functionality you get when you perform the task from a Mac or a Windows PC. And for now, I’d also recommend waiting until Apple announces the next iPad Pro in the spring before making an investment this big – unless you have an urgent need and won’t have FOMO about the latest new features. </p><p><strong>iPad Pro</strong> <strong>(6th generation</strong> <strong>)</strong> <strong>specs: Display</strong>: 11-inch Liquid Retina display or 12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR display with ProMotion and True Tone | <strong>Processor</strong>: Apple Silicon M2 | <strong>Storage</strong>: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB or 2TB | <strong>Biometrics</strong>: Face ID | <strong>Colors</strong>: Silver, space gray | <strong>Cameras</strong>: 12MP wide, 10MP ultrawide rear and 12MP TrueDepth FaceTime front | <strong>Weight</strong>: 11-inch: 1.03 pounds, 12.9-inch: 1.5 pounds | <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 11-inch: 9.74 x 7.02 x 0.23 inches, 12.9-inch: 11.04 x 8.46 x 0.25-inches | <strong>Connections</strong>: USB-C Thunderbolt&#x2F;USB-4 | <strong>Battery life:</strong> 10 hours</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G91LXFP/ref=asc_df_B09G91LXFP1727175600000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B09G91LXFP&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cd74f88af-e854-4ac8-95ce-54f775ea0a86%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/376373/633495/10014?prodsku=4901902&u=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252F-%252F4901902.p%253Fcmp%253DRMX&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/473657/7613?prodsku=MK7M3LL/A&u=https://www.apple.com/us/shop/go/product/MK7M3&intsrc=CATF_3652&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Light and compact</li><li>Supports 2nd-gen Apple Pencil</li><li>USB-C charging</li><li>Comes in four colors</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>No official keyboard case</li><li>Expensive for the feature set</li><li>Has the 64GB storage limitation for the base model</li></ul><h2 id="iPad-Mini-6th-generation"><a href="#iPad-Mini-6th-generation" class="headerlink" title="iPad Mini (6th generation)"></a>iPad Mini (6th generation)</h2><h3 id="Best-iPad-for-specific-use-cases"><a href="#Best-iPad-for-specific-use-cases" class="headerlink" title="Best iPad for specific use cases"></a>Best iPad for specific use cases</h3><p>The design of the iPad Mini (6th generation) makes it look a lot like a smaller iPad Air, and the technology inside the product is very consistent with that impression. The 8.3-inch tablet is nearly identical in specs to the 10.9-inch iPad Air. It’s essentially the smaller sibling, but it’s only $100 less expensive, starting at $499. </p><p>The iPad Mini feels more like a big smartphone than a small tablet at times. It can easily slip into bags, purses, and even the pockets of some cargo pants and vests. Compared to a phone, it’s better for reading ebooks, PDFs, documents, news apps, and other digital content – especially when leaning back in a chair or a couch. But it’s not quite as nice as reading on a full-size iPad propped up horizontally in a case when reading at a desk or table. The portability of the iPad Mini along with its support for the 2nd-gen Apple Pencil make note-taking a popular use case – although I consider the ReMarkable 2 a better note-taking tablet, if that’s the primary function you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-the-ipad-mini-6-is-apples-most-exciting-new-product-in-years/" >Why the iPad Mini 6 is Apple’s most exciting new product in years <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The main audience for the iPad Mini might be businesses with specific use cases such as retail customer service, point-of-sale, and logistics apps such as delivery. It’s also good to give to young kids as a first iPad since it’s smaller, lighter, and easier to handle. And there are rugged cases for it – which is critical for both little kids and many business use cases. </p><p>Customers who bought the iPad Mini reported in reviews that they were impressed by its battery life, durability, and its display, also noting its portability to fit in purses and bags, particularly for entertainment purposes. </p><p><strong>iPad Mini</strong> <strong>(6th generation)</strong> <strong>specs: Display</strong>: 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display | <strong>Processor</strong>: A15 Bionic | <strong>Storage</strong>: 64GB or 256GB | <strong>Biometrics</strong>: Touch ID | <strong>Colors</strong>: Space gray, pink, purple, starlight | <strong>Cameras</strong>: 8MP rear, 1080p video. 12MP FaceTime camera with Center Stage | <strong>Weight</strong>: 0.65 pounds | <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 7.69 x 5.3 x 0.25 inches | <strong>Connections</strong>: USB-C | <strong>Battery life:</strong> 10 hours</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UoBCgLTmznE?si=MXXiGsd2qpd_DrzE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-the-best-iPad"><a href="#What-is-the-best-iPad" class="headerlink" title="What is the best iPad?"></a>What is the best iPad?</h2><p>The best iPad overall is the iPad Air since it has many of the high-end features of the iPad Pro but isn’t quite as expensive.

In between these two you have the rest of the iPad lineup that comes in slight variations of the traditional 10-inch iPad form factor. Think about how much you want to use the iPad on the go and the bag you want to carry it in. Will you be carrying just the iPad or will you also be carrying a laptop?</li><li><strong>Accessories:</strong> Think about which iPads are compatible with the accessories you’d like to use such as the Magic Keyboard Case and the three different versions of the Apple Pencil.</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> There are now iPads for nearly every budget, especially when you include the last-generation models we’ve highlighted below in the Alternatives section. You can get a standard iPad for around $300 and it will be fine for watching videos, doing light web surfing, and answering messages. This is a great choice for a first iPad or to upgrade an older one used for the same tasks. The premium iPad Pro models are loaded with features, have incredible displays, and cost the same as a premium laptop. However, they are best for creative professionals, artists, and those who want to use the device as their full laptop replacement, which can still be a frustrating endeavor if you’re a power user with a long history on a laptop and you have a lot of work to do.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2En1CHbiYwA?si=jZKzTr9EIT2ShjGK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-do-we-test-iPads"><a href="#How-do-we-test-iPads" class="headerlink" title="How do we test iPads?"></a>How do we test iPads?</h2><p>I have been using an iPad since the day the first Apple tablet was released in 2010, and I have tried out nearly every iPad model at one point or another since then. I’ve tested the modern iPad models in real-world situations to evaluate their features, design, performance, and overall value. </p><p>For example, I’ve used the iPad Mini to take notes and read documents on the road. I’ve used the standard iPad for web browsing and watching YouTube. I’ve used the iPad Pro models for lots of Zoom calls, Slack, web apps, creating Google Docs, reading during lunch using the Kindle app and the Magic Keyboard case since it props up the iPad quite nicely, and downloading and watching videos while traveling. I’ve recently tried using the iPad Air for all the things I typically do with an iPad Pro and found that it works great with only two exceptions: the battery life isn’t as good and the fingerprint sensor isn’t as convenient as Face ID for all day use during a long day of meetings or work.</p><p>For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tablet testing methodology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HaM818fFKXQ?si=ZZLA4lFSHSgCpSE0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-the-newest-iPad-models"><a href="#What-are-the-newest-iPad-models" class="headerlink" title="What are the newest iPad models?"></a>What are the newest iPad models?</h2><p>Apple announced the 6th-generation iPad Air and the 7th-generation iPad Pro models on May 7.
