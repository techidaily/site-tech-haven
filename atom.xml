Yep, join the club. But you may want to try it again. Apple has finally transformed the much-maligned app into a more usable and friendly program. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PKTQ5699M62?hl=en-US&gl=US" >Available in the Microsoft Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the new iCloud for Windows comes with a complete redesign, new features, and bug fixes.</p><p>Beyond the redesign, the latest version offers an easier setup process with prompts to guide you each step of the way. It now supports physical security keys for a more secure sign-in. And thankfully, you won’t get as many of those sign-in prompts as you did in the past.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/goodbye-itunes-apple-officially-releases-replacement-media-apps-for-windows/" >Goodbye, iTunes: Apple officially releases replacement media apps for Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>You’re now able to see the syncing status of your iCloud content. In addition, Apple promises improvements to photo syncing and fixes for contact and calendar syncing with Outlook. The Outlook syncing, however, supposedly requires <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose/" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> version 22H2 or later.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The latest features and improvements are designed to fix an app that for years has been clunky, confusing, and buggy. Past versions of the app have received a slew of one-star ratings in the Microsoft Store. And that’s because you’re using a Windows PC and not a Mac.</p><p>Mac owners can easily sync their online iCloud content using a convenient and simple built-in MacOS feature. But Windows users have faced challenges in this process. With no iCloud syncing tool built into Windows, your only option has been the iCloud for Windows app. And this always felt like an app that Apple threw together haphazardly just to placate Windows users.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cloud-storage/" >The best cloud storage services <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For those of you who haven’t yet tried iCloud for Windows, the app lets you sync specific items stored in iCloud online to your Windows PC. In that vein, it offers several key features.</p><p>You can access and view your synced iCloud photos in the Microsoft Photos app for <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-11-faq-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can keep your photos up to date across your PC, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/" >iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Plus, you’re able to create shared albums that other people can view.</p><p>If you enable iCloud Drive, you can see and access your online folders and files directly in File Explorer. You’re also able to share files and automatically sync any changes to your files.</p><p>The app lets you sign in to websites using credentials you’ve stored in iCloud Keychain. You can access all your passwords and create new ones in the iCloud Passwords app, which is automatically added when you install iCloud for Windows. The iCloud Passwords extension also works in the desktop versions of Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. You can even generate verification codes to sign in to websites.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-access-and-sync-icloud-notes-on-linux/" >How to access and sync iCloud notes on Linux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>And there’s more. You’re able to view your iCloud calendars and contacts directly in Microsoft Outlook. And you can sync your bookmarks from Safari with the iCloud bookmarks extension in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.</p><p>If you already have a previous version of iCloud for Windows, the new version will automatically be installed the next time you open the app. If you don’t yet have it, head to its <a class="link"   href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PKTQ5699M62?hl=en-US&gl=US" >Microsoft Store page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download and install it.</p><p>After launching the app and signing in the first time, the setup screens will ask you which content you wish to sync. You can opt to sync your iCloud photos to the Microsoft Photos app, sync iCloud Drive to File Explorer, sync your passwords in iCloud Keychain, sync your Safari bookmarks, and sync your iCloud calendars and contacts with Outlook.</p><p>After the setup is complete, you’re placed at the newly-redesigned iCloud for Windows screen. Here, you can clearly see the syncing status of each type of content and choose which ones to turn on or off. The screen also shows you how much total space you’ve used in iCloud and how much is free.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/" >The best laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Is the new iCloud for Windows a dramatic improvement over its predecessor? A few people chiming in at the Microsoft Store have complained of syncing problems and other glitches. But an equal number have given the overhaul five-star ratings. Some reports say the app overall works better in Windows 11 than in <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-your-windows-10-pc-be-saved-in-2025-yes-for-free-heres-how/" >Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, especially the photo, contacts, and calendar syncing.</p><p>In my testing, the app ran smoothly in Windows 11 with no hiccups. It did crash once in Windows 10 when I was trying to sync my iCloud photos, but otherwise, it’s been behaving. At the very least, it already seems like a decided improvement over the old version.</p><h4 id="Apple"><a href="#Apple" class="headerlink" title="Apple"></a>Apple</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-hands-on/"  title="iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you&#39;ll get">iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you’ll get <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ios-18-settings-i-changed-immediately-and-why-you-should-too/"  title="6 iOS 18 settings I changed immediately -

I thus turn to a couple of tools to help me access iMessages while using Windows.</p><p>Built into Windows, Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-starts-official-roll-out-of-phone-link-for-ios-with-imessage-support/" >Phone Link app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lets you view your recent texts, create new messages, and respond to existing texts. Any texts you send and receive automatically sync between your PC and your iPhone, so you can pick up an ongoing conversation on either device.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-link-your-android-phone-to-your-windows-11-pc/" >How to link your Android phone to your Windows 11 PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-takes-a-crack-at-getting-windows-pcs-to-connect-seamlessly-with-android-phones-and-iphones/" >Intel Unison <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another app that will perform the same tricks and even let you add emojis and items pasted from the Windows clipboard. According to Intel, Unison works only on Evo-powered laptops running on its 13th-generation or higher processors. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/what-is-intel-evo-a-recipe-for-the-most-portable-longest-lasting-laptops" >Evo designation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> means that the PC has passed strict requirements from Intel, and such machines should have a label that identifies them as meeting these specifications.</p><p>The good news is that many people have reported being able to install Unison on older, non-Evo computers. I use Unison on an Intel 11th-Gen non-Evo laptop with no trouble, so you’ll want to try this on your PC, even if it’s an older model.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>There’s just one sticking point: Neither app supports Windows 10. Phone Link and Intel Unison each require Windows 11. If you run the latest version of Windows, here’s how to use these tools with your texts.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-send-and-receive-iMessages-on-Windows"><a href="#How-to-send-and-receive-iMessages-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="How to send and receive iMessages on Windows"></a>How to send and receive iMessages on Windows</h2><h2 id="Use-Microsoft-Phone-Link"><a href="#Use-Microsoft-Phone-Link" class="headerlink" title="Use Microsoft Phone Link"></a>Use Microsoft Phone Link</h2><p>Before you can use Phone Link, you’ll have to take care of a few items on your phone and your PC.</p><p>Your iPhone must have iOS 14 or higher. To confirm this, go to Settings, select General, and tap Software Update. You’ll be told that iOS is up-to-date or prompted to install the latest update. Next, go to Settings, select Bluetooth, and confirm that Bluetooth is turned on.</p><p>Microsoft added iPhone support to Phone Link in Windows 11 in early 2023. To make sure your operating system is up-to-date, head to Settings, select Windows Update, and click the button to check for updates. Allow the latest updates to download and install.</p><p>Next, confirm that you’re running the latest version of Phone Link. To do this, open the Microsoft Store app from the Start menu and click the Library icon. Click the Get Updates button and allow all your installed apps to be updated, including Phone Link if necessary.</p><p>Finally, ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on your Windows 11 PC.

Here’s why.</p><p>Given today’s economic environment with rising consumer prices, I am a bit surprised that Apple was able to hold the price of the new Watch Ultra 2 at the same level as last year. When you consider the titanium construction, integrated LTE radio, and sapphire glass display, $799 is very reasonable for a high-performance sports watch. That’s more true when you compare the Apple Watch Ultra 2 to other flagship GPS sports watches. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>As far as what’s new with the model, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 incorporates a faster S9 processor, a brighter display, twice the internal storage, and a series of recycled materials that, somehow, don’t make the wearable feel any bit worse. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-issues-emergency-security-updates-for-iphone-ipad-and-apple-watch/" >Apple issues security fixes for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch to fight Predator spyware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>WatchOS 10 was released when the Watch Ultra 2 was announced and it’s made the Apple Watch experience an absolute joy to use, with new functions for the side button and digital crown (Smart Stack), along with spacious and info-rich watch faces that are optimized for the Watch Ultra models.</p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Naturally, I placed the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-vs-ultra/" >Watch Ultra 2 next to my first-gen Watch Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and they were virtually indistinguishable from each other. After cranking up the brightness of both, I could barely tell the difference in standard lighting conditions due to Apple’s implementation of the same ambient light sensor. But in the outdoors, which is where you’ll be leveraging the Watch Ultra’s technologies the most, it was apparent that the Ultra 2 was significantly brighter (3,000 nits compared to 2,000 nits).</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-tips-2023/" >Apple pro tips: The best new features in iPhone 15, iOS 17, and Apple Watch unlocked <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Prior to the Watch Ultra 2 launch, I listed <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-three-features-that-would-make-me-upgrade-from-the-last-model/" >three features that I wanted to see <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to warrant an upgrade, and while Apple did not provide them, it did address one of my desires in a unique manner. The LED flashlight on <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-garmin-watch/" >Garmin watches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a tool that I use daily. On the Watch Ultra 2, once you turn on the flashlight, spinning the digital crown now ups the maximum brightness, making use of the extra nits. </p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>It still doesn’t beat out the Garmin LED, but it is much more practical than last year’s for finding things in the garage or under the bed, illuminating rooms at night, and finding your way in the dark outside.</p><p>Mapping, unfortunately, is still limited on the Apple Watch Ultra 2, with the most notable change being offline maps support, provided you have an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-every-iphone-that-will-get-ios-17/" >iPhone on iOS 17 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. However, the Compass app has also received a subtle yet significant upgrade thanks to watchOS 10. On the Watch Ultra 2, it now shows a waypoint for the last-detected cellular and emergency SOS locations, so you know exactly where to return to if you find yourself in a dead zone. The Compass app also lets you mark your camping spot, parking spot, and other useful waypoints.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apple-weaved-ai-into-the-iphone-15-and-apple-watch-9/" >How Apple weaved AI into the iPhone 15 and Apple Watch 9 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Alongside Watch Ultra 2, Apple released new carbon-neutral watch bands, with three colors being offered across the Alpine Loop and Trail Loop bands. I had a chance to test the gray&#x2F;green Trail Loop with the Watch Ultra 2, and all I can say is that it’s extremely comfortable. I bought my Watch Ultra with an Ocean band last year but will likely pick up the Trail Loop this time around due to its easy Velcro secure support. For more casual outings, it’s the ideal watch band.</p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Finally, as much as I enjoy the Apple Watch Ultra 2 for its long battery life, brighter display, expanded connectivity, and new watch bands, I’ve also been enjoying the improved mental health functionality via the Mindfulness app. It has now earned a prominent spot in my app list, and I’ve been entering my state of mind on a daily basis. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-watchos-10-feature-is-overlooked-underrated-and-life-changing/" >My favorite WatchOS 10 feature is overlooked, underrated, and life-changing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I now frequently use the Reflect and Breathe utilities, which have slowly but surely reduced my stress, proving to be a welcome addition to my Apple Watch use. (Of course, you only need an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> running on watchOS 10 to use the Mindfulness app. I just like using it on the larger display of the Ultra!)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137379/7443" target="_top" id="2137379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ZDNET’s-buying-advice"><a href="#ZDNET’s-buying-advice" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET’s buying advice"></a>ZDNET’s buying advice</h2><p>With my primary SIM now living as an eSIM in the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro/6.7-inch-display-256gb-natural-titanium-unlocked&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 Pro Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHX9N594?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca607c1a0-0b61-473b-aa80-b8afb8008a3f%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Apple Watch Ultra 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be staying on my wrist for an extended period of time – likely until the next Ultra version comes out.

Those include: </p><ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> When looking for the best cheap tablets, we first narrowed down the list by looking at prices at the bottom third of the tablet market. That means anything roughly $350 to $400 or less, with the majority of our options between $100 and $200.</li><li><strong>Hands-on experience:</strong> Once I had a price point, I started reading reviews and tapping into my own personal experience, as well as other ZDNET staff who have used these tablets. Most of the tablets on this list have been reviewed by our writers, so there’s a level of trust and first-hand experience we are pulling from when we curate these best lists. If we haven’t tested the product ourselves but still include it on the list, it is because the product is highly regarded and we have done enough research to believe it has a spot on this list.</li><li><strong>Durability:</strong> A nice tablet is good and plenty, but it should also last you a long time to truly get your money’s worth. Many of these tablets have rugged features, so that if you end up accidentally dropping it it won’t shatter and the screen won’t crack.</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> The downside of a cheaper piece of tech is, unfortunately, slower performance. We sought out tablets with high-performing CPUs and above-average performance, so even if you do end up opting for an inexpensive device, you aren’t sacrificing high performance for a low cost.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136620/26400" target="_top" id="2136620">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136620" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136620/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-we-test-tablets"><a href="#How-we-test-tablets" class="headerlink" title="How we test tablets"></a>How we test tablets</h2><p>The ZDNET team chose all of the tablets included in this list based on their performance when <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tested in the real world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.</p><ul><li><strong>Display</strong>: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy.<br>We also compare the display’s performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen’s responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer’s stylus.</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet’s temperature during intensive tasks.</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong>: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.</li><li><strong>Camera and audio:</strong> For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.</li></ul><p>For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tablet testing methodology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135413/19272" target="_top" id="2135413">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135413" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135413/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-brand-is-best-for-tablets"><a href="#What-brand-is-best-for-tablets" class="headerlink" title="What brand is best for tablets?"></a>What brand is best for tablets?</h2><p>The best cheap tablets come from brands like Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Amazon, and Lenovo, among others.</p><p>You can find more cheap Android tablets than cheap Apple tablets, but Apple usually has tablets deals during big sales events or holidays.</p><h2 id="Are-cheap-tablets-good-for-students"><a href="#Are-cheap-tablets-good-for-students" class="headerlink" title="Are cheap tablets good for students?"></a>Are cheap tablets good for students?</h2><p>That really depends on the kind of classwork someone will be doing. Younger children may benefit from using a tablet over a traditional laptop–with intuitive touch controls, it will be easier for them to navigate through menus and apps required to attend virtual classes or to turn in assignments. Older students will be doing more intensive coursework, and tablets aren’t best suited for things like word processing or making spreadsheets. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad-for-college/"><strong>The best iPads for college students</strong></a></p><p>Art students are the ones who will benefit most from using a tablet for classes since they can draw, sketch, and digitally paint similar to how they would with a physical pen and paper.

That subscription tier costs $84 a year. There are various pricing tiers, based on how much you plan on using the Teams feature.

Some were good, others have been great. I tried to approach this list by looking at those apps that only meet the latter requirement. Each one of these apps fits a specific role and provides a unique experience that improves upon what Apple includes in iPadOS on its own. </p><p>Here are the factors I considered: </p><p><strong>Third-party syncing:</strong> It’s important to be able to sync your work with productivity apps, so I stuck with apps that allow third-party app syncing. </p><p><strong>Productivity features:</strong> Productivity means different things to different people, so I included apps with different productivity features. Whether you’re looking to streamline your emails, optimize your calendar, or edit your text, I included a variety of apps with different productivity focuses.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Apps vary in pricing from free, subscription based, or even one-time purchases, so I included a variety of price points. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484950/16446" target="_top" id="1484950">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484950" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484950/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-can-an-iPad-increase-productivity"><a href="#How-can-an-iPad-increase-productivity" class="headerlink" title="How can an iPad increase productivity?"></a>How can an iPad increase productivity?</h2><p>With the addition of Apple’s M1 Processor to more recent iPad models, the iPad is arguably just about the same as a Macbook or iMac these days in terms of speed and capabilities.

Now, the 10th-generation iPad takes the lead as Apple’s easy-to-recommend tablet, thanks to its new lower price point.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >new iPad Air <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPad Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> have M2 and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-ipad-pros-new-outrageously-powerful-m4-chip-designed-for-ai-workloads/" >M4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> chips, respectively; both processors are typically found in Apple’s highly-capable MacBook computers, making the newer iPads faster and more capable to use.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-hardware-blitz-in-the-m4-ipad-pro-is-missing-the-software-magic-to-make-it-sing/" >Apple’s hardware blitz in the M4 iPad Pro is missing the software magic to make it sing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Still, the 10th-generation iPad is an excellent option for people who don’t need their iPad to run graphics-heavy software applications.

Now, Apple has made significant improvements and, as a result, may be nearing the implementation of the technology into its Apple Watch. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-10-early-black-friday-2023-apple-watch-deals/" >The 10 best early Black Friday 2023 Apple watch deals <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>To take blood glucose measurements, users typically have to prick their skin. Therefore, developing a non-invasive way to read a person’s glucose levels would be a massive game-changer for diabetics. </p><p>According to the report, when first implemented, the blood glucose system would determine how a person’s blood sugar is trending instead of providing exact numbers. The systems would use those trends to warn users of prediabetes risk. </p><p>Similarly, the first iteration of the blood pressure sensor would let users know if their blood pressure is trending upward and give users the option to journal when the hypertension occurred, according to the report. </p><p>Then, the user would be prompted to talk to their doctor or monitor their blood pressure using a traditional instrument. </p><p>The report says the Apple Watch might also have a sleep apnea detection feature that would use a person’s sleep and breathing patterns to estimate whether the person has the condition. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/tech-gift-guide/" >The 10 best tech gifts of 2023 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Besides adding new features, Apple may expand the existing technology on the watch to deliver more functionality. </p><p>For example, the Apple Watch’s thermometer, which is currently only <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-8-body-temperature-sensor-ovulation-cycles-tracking/" >used for fertility tracking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, could be used to detect fevers, too.</p><p>The company is also reportedly seeking health regulatory approval to interpret blood oxygen data. Right now, the Watch shows users oxygen blood data without telling them what it means. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135350/19272" target="_top" id="2135350">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135350" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135350/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="AirPods"><a href="#AirPods" class="headerlink" title="AirPods"></a>AirPods</h2><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Although Apple’s different <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-airpods/" >AirPod models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> do an excellent job at fulfilling users’ listening needs, they have strayed away from the health and wellness field.

The latest update to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.keyboardsettlement.com/" >MacBook Keyboard Litigation Settlement website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> says that payments would be issued for approved claims by August 2024. Based on a report from 9to5Mac and other sites, some people <a class="link"   href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/03/apple-payout-butterfly-keyboard/" >have already received checks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for as much as $395.</p><p>To cash in on the settlement, you must have purchased a MacBook with a butterfly keyboard between 2015 and 2019. You also must have gotten keyboard repairs or service for your system.</p><p>If you had at least two topcase replacements within four years of purchase, you could get up to $395. If you had just one topcase replacement, you may be due as much as $125. A topcase consists mainly of the battery, keyboard, and a few smaller components. If you only ordered keycap replacements, your payout would be no more than $50.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/sorry-apple-this-logitech-keyboard-is-my-new-go-to-for-the-mac/" >Sorry, Apple: This Logitech keyboard is my new go-to for the Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Whatever types of repairs you received, you must have already filed a claim by now, as the deadlines all passed on March 6. In the claim, you would’ve had to assert that the repairs didn’t fix the keyboard issues. If you did file a claim, then there’s nothing more you need to do. Apple will notify you via email when your check or electronic payment has been sent.</p><p>The entire process has dragged on for quite a while. Although Apple settled the case in July 2022, the court didn’t approve Apple’s settlement until May 2023 and took until June 27, 2024, to issue the payment order.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-agrees-to-settle-class-action-suit-over-problematic-butterfly-keyboards/" >class action lawsuit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stems from Apple’s decision to switch its MacBooks from a scissor-style keyboard to a butterfly design with less key travel. The goal was to make the keyboards thinner and the laptops slimmer. </p><p>This move backfired spectacularly as many MacBook owners started complaining that the keys would easily stick or get jammed by dust, crumbs, or other tiny objects. Noted tech blogger John Gruber even called the new keyboards “<a class="link"   href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/03/27/strn-kyboard" >the worst products in Apple’s history <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.”</p><p>The lawsuit alleged that the butterfly keyboards used in the MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro were flawed and defective, creating challenges for consumers unlucky enough to have bought one. In <a class="link"   href="https://chimicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Settlement-Agreement-H0112783xCF4AF.pdf" >settling the lawsuit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Apple didn’t admit any wrongdoing, denied all the allegations in the lawsuit, and maintained that the MacBooks were not defective. Despite its denials, the company switched its MacBooks <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-16-inch-macbook-pro-teardown-reveals-old-scissor-switch-keyboard-in-all-its-glory/" >back to the standard scissor-style keyboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2019.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/"  title="20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really">20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/"  title="Want a programming job?

People not interested in these updates or on a budget may want to purchase last year’s iPhone 15 instead. It’s still a great phone.</p><p>To help you make this decision, we’ve broken down all of the most important details for the Phone 15 and iPhone 16 below.

Chief among them is the long-awaited Siri upgrade. The iOS assistant is much smarter than before as it is now aware of on-screen content, can better understand commands even if you stumble over your words, and can switch between text and voice inputs. This is just the tip of the iceberg, too, as Siri will fully integrate itself with <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-chatgpt-the-worlds-most-popular-ai-chatbot-explained/#link={" >ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> later in the year.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-airpods-pro-2-can-soon-double-as-over-the-counter-hearing-aids-heres-how/" >Your AIrPods Pro 2 can soon double as over-the-counter hearing aids. Here’s how <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>There is more to the AI features beyond Siri. Apple Intelligence will be able to summarize notifications and Priority Messages in the Mail app. Like Siri, the feature will be able to understand context. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >Apple Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will gain additional features later in the year like the ability to create custom emojis and perform multiple actions across apps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082521/7443" target="_top" id="2082521">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082521" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082521/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-You-want-a-better-photography-experience"><a href="#2-You-want-a-better-photography-experience" class="headerlink" title="2.

On the back will be a 48MP Fusion camera serving as the main lens. It’ll have a 2x Telephoto option for up-close photography. Apple states it’ll be like having “two cameras in one.” Alongside it will be a 12MP Ultra Wide lens with an autofocus function that can enable “macro photography.” It can also take in “2.6x times more light [than before] for higher image quality.” </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/" >The 5 best iPhone 16 Pro features that enthusiasts will care about <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>On the side below the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/" >Power Button is the new Camera Control <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a tactile switch with a special sensor that can perform unique actions with a light touch. For example, pressing it quickly launches the Camera app for taking quick snapshots or recording a video. It even introduces a preview feature to help you frame the shot.

You want “next-level performance”</h3><p>Powering the iPhone 16 will be Apple’s A18 chipset which the tech giant claims “delivers a huge leap in performance and power efficiency.” Its processor is 30 faster than the iPhone 15’s A16 Bionic chip and requires 30 percent less power for the same workloads. The GPU on the iPhone 16 is better too, boasting a 40 percent speed boost over the previous generation.</p><p>Gamers, in particular, will appreciate the stronger performance. Apple says players will enjoy higher graphical fidelity and consistent frame rates. The tech giant says the iPhone 16 will house a better battery. At the time of writing, it’s unknown what Apple has done to improve the batteries. However, it revealed that it updated the internal design of the iPhone 16 to allow for a larger power source and “to better dissipate heat”.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Buy the iPhone 16 View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-iPhone-15-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-iPhone-15-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the iPhone 15 if…"></a>You should buy the iPhone 15 if…</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948954/19272" target="_top" id="1948954">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948954" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948954/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-You-don’t-require-the-generative-AI-capabilities"><a href="#1-You-don’t-require-the-generative-AI-capabilities" class="headerlink" title="1.

You don’t require the generative AI capabilities</h3><p>All of the bells and whistles on the iPhone 16 are certainly nice, but are they must-haves? To many people, probably not. Generative AI still has its’ issues despite advancing rapidly in the past couple of years. Apple Intelligence and the new Siri may be great, but we wouldn’t be surprised to see users encounter performance problems or hallucinations.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-plus-review/" >iPhone 15 review: Why I recommend this model even to ‘Pro’ users in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Sometimes, it’s best to wait until all the bugs have been ironed out. Plus, there’s a lot of uncertainty surrounding the chipset. Early impressions indicate the A18 can handle all the AI features, but can it? Or will we see a performance drop once it launches? </p><h3 id="2-You’re-on-a-budget"><a href="#2-You’re-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="2. You’re on a budget"></a>2. You’re on a budget</h3><p>With the release of a new model, older phones often see a price drop, and that is exactly what we’re getting here. Apple has cut the price of the iPhone 15 by about $100 off its digital storefront to entice new adopters. </p><p>It wouldn’t be a bad pick-up, either. The camera system of the previous generation is great to this day, the A16 Bionic chip is still plenty powerful, and the Dynamic Island is a welcomed addition. You can enjoy a similar camera performance. Plus, you won’t be bogged down by nascent AI features you may or may not ever use. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/376373/633495/10014?prodsku=6417992&u=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252F-%252F6417992.p%253Fcmp%253DRMX&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >Buy the iPhone 15 $729.99 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Alternatives-to-consider"><a href="#Alternatives-to-consider" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to consider"></a>Alternatives to consider</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BN96HVTW/ref=asc_df_B0BN96HVTW1725620400000?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C02c949cf-47ed-4ac1-b009-a0ef87ed0f3a%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >BEST iPHONE ALTERNATIVE iPhone 14 Pro Bargain hunters should check the iPhone 13 Pro.

But if you’re one of the many who are planning to buy an Ultra wearable for the first time, this is as good as it gets. Here’s why.</p><p>Given today’s economic environment with rising consumer prices, I am a bit surprised that Apple was able to hold the price of the new Watch Ultra 2 at the same level as last year. When you consider the titanium construction, integrated LTE radio, and sapphire glass display, $799 is very reasonable for a high-performance sports watch. That’s more true when you compare the Apple Watch Ultra 2 to other flagship GPS sports watches. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>As far as what’s new with the model, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 incorporates a faster S9 processor, a brighter display, twice the internal storage, and a series of recycled materials that, somehow, don’t make the wearable feel any bit worse. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-issues-emergency-security-updates-for-iphone-ipad-and-apple-watch/" >Apple issues security fixes for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch to fight Predator spyware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>WatchOS 10 was released when the Watch Ultra 2 was announced and it’s made the Apple Watch experience an absolute joy to use, with new functions for the side button and digital crown (Smart Stack), along with spacious and info-rich watch faces that are optimized for the Watch Ultra models.</p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Naturally, I placed the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-vs-ultra/" >Watch Ultra 2 next to my first-gen Watch Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and they were virtually indistinguishable from each other. After cranking up the brightness of both, I could barely tell the difference in standard lighting conditions due to Apple’s implementation of the same ambient light sensor. But in the outdoors, which is where you’ll be leveraging the Watch Ultra’s technologies the most, it was apparent that the Ultra 2 was significantly brighter (3,000 nits compared to 2,000 nits).</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-tips-2023/" >Apple pro tips: The best new features in iPhone 15, iOS 17, and Apple Watch unlocked <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Prior to the Watch Ultra 2 launch, I listed <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-three-features-that-would-make-me-upgrade-from-the-last-model/" >three features that I wanted to see <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to warrant an upgrade, and while Apple did not provide them, it did address one of my desires in a unique manner. The LED flashlight on <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-garmin-watch/" >Garmin watches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a tool that I use daily. On the Watch Ultra 2, once you turn on the flashlight, spinning the digital crown now ups the maximum brightness, making use of the extra nits. </p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>It still doesn’t beat out the Garmin LED, but it is much more practical than last year’s for finding things in the garage or under the bed, illuminating rooms at night, and finding your way in the dark outside.</p><p>Mapping, unfortunately, is still limited on the Apple Watch Ultra 2, with the most notable change being offline maps support, provided you have an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-every-iphone-that-will-get-ios-17/" >iPhone on iOS 17 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. However, the Compass app has also received a subtle yet significant upgrade thanks to watchOS 10. On the Watch Ultra 2, it now shows a waypoint for the last-detected cellular and emergency SOS locations, so you know exactly where to return to if you find yourself in a dead zone. The Compass app also lets you mark your camping spot, parking spot, and other useful waypoints.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apple-weaved-ai-into-the-iphone-15-and-apple-watch-9/" >How Apple weaved AI into the iPhone 15 and Apple Watch 9 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Alongside Watch Ultra 2, Apple released new carbon-neutral watch bands, with three colors being offered across the Alpine Loop and Trail Loop bands. I had a chance to test the gray&#x2F;green Trail Loop with the Watch Ultra 2, and all I can say is that it’s extremely comfortable. I bought my Watch Ultra with an Ocean band last year but will likely pick up the Trail Loop this time around due to its easy Velcro secure support. For more casual outings, it’s the ideal watch band.</p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Finally, as much as I enjoy the Apple Watch Ultra 2 for its long battery life, brighter display, expanded connectivity, and new watch bands, I’ve also been enjoying the improved mental health functionality via the Mindfulness app. It has now earned a prominent spot in my app list, and I’ve been entering my state of mind on a daily basis. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-watchos-10-feature-is-overlooked-underrated-and-life-changing/" >My favorite WatchOS 10 feature is overlooked, underrated, and life-changing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I now frequently use the Reflect and Breathe utilities, which have slowly but surely reduced my stress, proving to be a welcome addition to my Apple Watch use.

After all, your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ipad-wont-turn-on-4103788" >iPad won’t turn on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if it doesn’t have power. An iPad’s battery generally has a life of a few years, but it will eventually start to hold less power and need to be recharged more often.</p><p> It’s not easy to replace the battery in an iPad because Apple designs its products with solid cases that can only be opened with effort and skill. But that doesn’t mean you need to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/list-of-ipad-models-and-generations-1994232" >buy a new iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when the battery starts to die.</p><p> Here are four options for replacing an iPad battery that won’t hold a charge:  </p><h2 id="Battery-Replacement-for-iPads-Under-Warranty-AppleCare"><a href="#Battery-Replacement-for-iPads-Under-Warranty-AppleCare" class="headerlink" title="Battery Replacement for iPads Under Warranty (AppleCare)"></a>Battery Replacement for iPads Under Warranty (AppleCare)</h2><p> If your iPad is under its original warranty, or you purchased<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-warranty-plus-applecare-1999284" >AppleCare <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that’s still in effect, Apple will replace the battery (actually, the entire iPad) for free. Know, however, that a warranty doesn’t cover batteries that have suffered from normal wear and tear.</p><p> You can<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/is-your-phone-under-warranty-2000667" >check if your iPad is still under warranty <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by entering your iPhone’s serial number into <a class="link"   href="https://checkcoverage.apple.com/" >Apple’s warranty checker tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .  </p><p> If your warranty is still active,<a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/ipad/repair" >go to Apple’s iPad Repair &amp; Service support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and select<strong>Get service</strong> . You can also<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-an-apple-genius-bar-appointment-1999601" >set up an appointment at an Apple Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and take your iPad in.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/back-up-your-ipad-1999864" >Back up your iPad data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before handing over your iPad to avoid losing your data. The repaired or replaced iPad should arrive three to five business days after you give yours to Apple.</p><p> Apple may test your iPad to see if the problem was caused by something not covered by the warranty (if so, your replacement likely won’t be free). Also, if the iPad has an engraving on it, the turnaround time can be up to two weeks, since Apple will also engrave the replacement iPad.</p><p> While<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/reasons-not-to-buy-iphone-insurance-1999610" >we don’t recommend buying additional insurance for your devices <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you may have insured your iPad (or have a policy that covers all your tech). If so, check your insurance policy to see if battery replacement is covered.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137216/26400" target="_top" id="2137216">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137216" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137216/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Replacement-for-iPads-With-Expired-Warranty"><a href="#Battery-Replacement-for-iPads-With-Expired-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="Battery Replacement for iPads With Expired Warranty"></a>Battery Replacement for iPads With Expired Warranty</h2><p> If your iPad is out of warranty, Apple will repair the battery for a fee. How much it costs depends on the model; see the iPad Repair &amp; Service page above for an estimate. To initiate a repair, start a service request on Apple’s site or go to an Apple Store.</p><p> Even if you have to pay for the battery replacement, it’s a decent price to get an iPad working again. That said, you should consider the cost of repair versus the cost of getting a new iPad. If the iPad with the failed battery is old, it may be better to put that money toward the cost of buying a new iPad.</p><p> You can<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ipad-battery-life-tips-1999807" >extend your iPad’s battery life <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by disabling certain features like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when not in use.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/used-ipad-guide-how-to-1994595" >5 Things to Consider Before Buying a Used iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144276/7443" target="_top" id="2144276">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144276" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144276/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="iPad-Battery-Replacement-at-Authorized-Repair-Shops"><a href="#iPad-Battery-Replacement-at-Authorized-Repair-Shops" class="headerlink" title="iPad Battery Replacement at Authorized Repair Shops"></a>iPad Battery Replacement at Authorized Repair Shops</h2><p> Some shops repair iPad screens and batteries. These repair shops may even be found in kiosks in many malls and may charge less than Apple. If you plan to use one of these repair shops, look for one that is authorized by Apple to provide repairs. That means they’re trained and experienced. An inexperienced repair person may cause more problems than they solve. Apple may not fix these problems if they were performed by an unauthorized provider.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1265663">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1265663.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4482-1265663">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1265663.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmartinic.evyy.net%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1265663%2F4482'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1265663/4482"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="DIY-iPad-Battery-Replacement"><a href="#DIY-iPad-Battery-Replacement" class="headerlink" title="DIY iPad Battery Replacement"></a>DIY iPad Battery Replacement</h2><p> It’s possible to replace an iPad battery yourself with the right tools and skills. Only try this do-it-yourself option ​if you’re tech-savvy and willing to risk destroying your iPad. It will cost between $50 and $90 to buy the tools and parts needed to replace the iPad battery. But remember: Repairing your own iPad voids its warranty (if it’s still under warranty).

Finally, OpenAI’s ChatGPT monopoly would be broken, and we’d get worthy competition.</p><p> But Bard was never the AI titan people hoped for, and GPT-4 remains the dominant generative AI chat bot platform. Now, Google’s Gemini is here—but is the long-awaited AI model better than ChatGPT?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137223/26400" target="_top" id="2137223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137223/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-Google’s-Gemini-AI-Model"><a href="#What-Is-Google’s-Gemini-AI-Model" class="headerlink" title="What Is Google’s Gemini AI Model?"></a>What Is Google’s Gemini AI Model?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-googles-ai-project-gemini/" >Gemini is Google’s most capable generative AI model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , able to understand and operate across different data formats, including text, audio, image, and video. It is Google’s attempt to create a unified AI model drawing capabilities from its most capable AI technologies. Gemini will be available in three variants:</p><ol><li><strong>Gemini Ultra:</strong> The largest and most capable variant designed to handle highly complex tasks.</li><li><strong>Gemini Pro:</strong> The best model for scaling and delivering high performance across a wide range of tasks, but less capable than Ultra.</li><li><strong>Gemini Nano:</strong> The most efficient model designed for on-device task deployment. For example, developers can use Gemini Nano to build mobile apps or integrated systems, bringing powerful AI into the mobile space.</li></ol><p> On its official blog,<a class="link"   href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/" >The Keyword <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Google says Gemini Ultra outperforms the state-of-the-art in several benchmarks. Google claims Gemini Ultra beats the industry-leading GPT-4 in several key benchmarks.</p><p> With an unprecedented 90.0% score on the rigorous MMLU benchmark, Google says Gemini Ultra is the first model to surpass human-level performance on this multifaceted test spanning 57 subjects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-gemini-ai-data-comparing-to-open-ai-gpt4-model.jpg"                      alt="google gemini ai data comparing to open ai gpt4 model"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/#performance" >Google <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Gemini Ultra can also understand, explain, and generate high-quality code in some of the world’s most popular programming languages, including Go, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++. On paper, these are all great results. But these are all benchmarks, and benchmarks do not always tell the whole story. So, how well does Gemini perform in real-world tasks?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137229/26400" target="_top" id="2137229">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137229" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137229/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Use-Google-Gemini-AI"><a href="#How-to-Use-Google-Gemini-AI" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Google Gemini AI"></a>How to Use Google Gemini AI</h2><p> Of the three variants of the Gemini AI model, you can start using Gemini Pro right now. Gemini Pro is currently available on Google’s Bard chatbot. To use Gemini Pro with Bard, head to<a class="link"   href="http://bard.google.com/chat" >bard.google.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and sign in with your Google account.</p><p> Google says that Gemini Ultra will roll out in January 2024, so we’ve had to settle for testing Gemini Pro against ChatGPT for now.</p><h2 id="How-Gemini-Compares-to-GPT-3-5-and-GPT-4"><a href="#How-Gemini-Compares-to-GPT-3-5-and-GPT-4" class="headerlink" title="How Gemini Compares to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4"></a>How Gemini Compares to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4</h2><p> When any new AI model is launched, it is tested against OpenAI’s GPT AI models, which are generally accepted as the state-of-the-art model other models should be held up against. So, using Bard and ChatGPT, we tested Gemini’s ability in math, creative writing, code generation, and accurately processing image inputs.</p><p> Starting with the easiest math question we could think of, we asked both chatbots to solve:<strong>-1 x -1 x -1</strong> .</p><p> Bard went first. We repeated the question twice, all coming back with wrong answers. We did get the answer on the third attempt, but that doesn’t count.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bard-answers-math-question.jpg"                      alt="Bard answers Math question"                ></p><p>We tried ChatGPT running on GPT-3.5.

It declined, saying it can’t interpret images with people in it. ChatGPT, running GPT-4V, was willing and able to do so flawlessly.</p><p> We tried another attempt at making it interpret an image while testing its problem-solving and coding ability. We gave Bard, running Gemini Pro, a screenshot and asked it to interpret and write HTML and CSS code to replicate the screenshot.</p><p>Here’s the source screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screenshot-to-replicate.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of Chatbase chatbot creator"                ></p><p> Below is Gemini Pro’s attempt to interpret and replicate the screenshot using HTML and CSS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/results-of-screenshot-replication-by-bard.jpg"                      alt="results of screenshot replication by Bard"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896532/19272" target="_top" id="1896532">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896532" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896532/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> And here’s GPT-4’s attempt at replicating the screenshot. The result is not surprising, considering GPT-4 has historically been strong at coding.

It showed marginal improvements from previous tests we’ve done in the past. Here’s the result:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bard-writes-peom.jpg"                      alt="Bard running Gemini Pro writes a poem"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938693/19272" target="_top" id="1938693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938693/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> At this point, we thought comparing the results against GPT-3.5 rather than the supercharged GPT-4 would be more appropriate.

We truly hope it is, and that it meets or exceeds the claims made in the Gemini Ultra announcement. But until we see and test the best version of Google’s generative AI tool, we won’t know if it can unseat other AI model competitors. As it stands, GPT-4 remains the undisputed AI model champion.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instantly-display-pics-on-platforms-with-this-guide/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Instantly Display Pics on Platforms with This Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/chatgpt-boundaries-7-prompts-it-struggles-with-explained/"><u>ChatGPT Boundaries: 7 Prompts It Struggles With Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-great.techidaily.com/elevate-your-online-presence-using-manycams-virtual-camera-technology-and-editing-tools/"><u>Elevate Your Online Presence Using ManyCam's Virtual Camera Technology and Editing Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/expert-tips-how-to-wipe-clean-your-chat-history-with-gpt-ai/"><u>Expert Tips: How to Wipe Clean Your Chat History with GPT AI</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/game-on-for-gaiety-your-must-try-10/"><u>Game On for Gaiety Your Must-Try 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-iphone-xs-passcode-screen-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Unlock iPhone XS Passcode Screen?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/24-snippet-spectacle-top-hashes-to-trigger-the-viral-spree-on-youtube/"><u>In 2024, Snippet Spectacle Top Hashes to Trigger the Viral Spree on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/introduce-circular-smoothing-transition-via-adobe-photoshop/"><u>Introduce Circular Smoothing Transition via Adobe Photoshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/logic-pro-method-to-gradually-reduce-audio-levels-for-2024/"><u>Logic Pro Method to Gradually Reduce Audio Levels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-free-mov-video-rotator-top-picks-and-reviews-for-2024/"><u>New Free MOV Video Rotator Top Picks and Reviews for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/swift-solutions-to-overcome-0x8004def5-a-win11-perspective/"><u>Swift Solutions to Overcome 0X8004DEF5 - A Win11 Perspective</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/the-top-8-ai-powered-chrome-extensions-for-productivity/"><u>The Top 8 AI-Powered Chrome Extensions for Productivity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/top-8-ai-enhanced-browser-addons-boosting-your-work-efficiency/"><u>Top 8 AI-Enhanced Browser Addons Boosting Your Work Efficiency</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/understanding-llama2-features-and-applications/"><u>Understanding LLAMA2: Features & Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-latest-on-social-media-new-twitter-hoax-introduction-of-metas-verification-feature-and-insights-into-chatgpt-4/"><u>Unveiling the Latest on Social Media: New Twitter Hoax, Introduction of Meta's Verification Feature, & Insights Into ChatGPT-4</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Next, click <strong>Add Private Prompt</strong>, and a new prompt template will appear.</p><p> Next, fill out all the details of your prompt. Note that providing more detailed information in the <strong>Prompt Template</strong> field will increase your prompt’s value and the response quality from ChatGPT. Let’s say you wish to create a prompt to promote your business on Facebook. You can provide specific details like the name of your business, your services, your target audience, hashtags to use, and the tone of voice. In the same field, create the task by writing the instructions that ChatGPT will follow to generate the desired text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/create-aiprm-prompt-template.jpeg"                      alt="AIPRM screenshot showing how to create a template"                ></p><p> For instance, “Write a Facebook post with emojis and a call to action about <strong>[PROMPT]</strong>.” Make sure to add the prompt variable <strong>[PROMPT]</strong> in your template, as it will be replaced by what you type whenever you use this prompt. In this example, the prompt variable <strong>[PROMPT]</strong> will be the topic for the Facebook post. You can also provide one or more examples of what you want the output to look like.</p><p> Next, fill in the <strong>Teaser</strong> field. This is a description to help you remember the prompt easily. The <strong>Prompt Hint</strong> reminds you of what you will type in when using the prompt. This replaces the prompt variable <strong>[PROMPT]</strong>.</p><p> Now, choose a <strong>Title</strong> for your prompt. This can be anything that will help you remember the purpose of the prompt.</p><p> Lastly, select the <strong>Topic</strong>, <strong>Activity</strong>, <strong>Who can see this?</strong> and <strong>Made for</strong> (the ChatGPT model). Write your <strong>Author Name</strong> and <strong>Author URL</strong>. Click <strong>Save Prompt</strong> to finalize the creation of your prompt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/aiprm-prompt-template-creation.jpeg"                      alt="AIPRM for ChatGPT prompt template creation page"                ></p><p> Once your prompt is saved, you can find it under the <strong>Own</strong> tab.</p><p> You have just created your first AIPRM prompt!

The idea of two independent earbuds that stayed in sync, were easy to use, and had respectable battery life was considered nothing more than a dream. </p><p>Fast forward to 2021, and Apple’s AirPods have spurred the creation of completely wireless buds from nearly every major tech company – and even smaller ones. For its part, Apple has released the AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and, more recently, the 3rd generation AirPods. The newest model boasts a completely new design and new features that were once reserved for its more expensive AirPods. </p><p>At $179, the base model AirPods saw a small price increase, with Apple keeping the 2nd generation AirPods in the lineup at $129. </p><p><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C66e3d07d-5080-462f-a168-a8dca8eacf13%7Cdtp&dtb=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/2021/11/09/7f658c09-25b4-49fd-b36c-477add905a80/airpods-third-gen-2.jpg"                      alt="airpods-third-gen-2.jpg"                > Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) 4.5 &#x2F; 5  Very good</a> </p><h4 id="pros-and-cons"><a href="#pros-and-cons" class="headerlink" title="pros and cons"></a>pros and cons</h4><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Long battery life</li><li>Solid sound quality</li><li>Multiple charging options</li><li>Spatial Audio</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>No noise cancellation</li><li>Some will have an issue with the fit</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C66e3d07d-5080-462f-a168-a8dca8eacf13%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >$175 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="A-familiar-but-different-design"><a href="#A-familiar-but-different-design" class="headerlink" title="A familiar, but different design"></a>A familiar, but different design</h2><p>Left: Apple’s newest AirPods. Right: AirPods Pro</p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>Apple’s standard AirPods have had the same design since their debut in 2016, but rumors circulated for the last year that the 3rd generation AirPods would look more like the AirPods Pro. </p><p>Sure enough, when Apple finally announced the 2021 AirPods, they debuted with a brand new look. The stems that come out of each earbud are shorter, and the earbuds themselves have a slightly new shape. The AirPods lack any sort of replaceable ear tip, with Apple keeping the one-size-fits-all approach it’s taken with standard AirPods since their launch. </p><p>On each earbud is a new sensor that detects when it’s in contact with your skin, enabling features like auto-connect and auto-pause or play when you put them in or take them out of your ears. </p><p>The stems each have a force sensor embedded. Squeezing either one will do things like pause or play music, answer a call, or trigger Siri, Apple’s personal voice assistant. </p><p>The charging case also looks more like the AirPods Pro case – only smaller. There’s a single indicator light on the front of the case to let you know when it’s charging or in pairing mode. On the back of the case is a button that you’ll use to reset the AirPods or pair them to a non-Apple device. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118326/7443" target="_top" id="2118326">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118326" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118326/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-wireless-earbuds/" >The best wireless earbuds With good earbuds, you can do everything from making calls when you’re on the move to listening to your favorite music to blocking out the world around you.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Charging the case, and thus the AirPods, can now be done three different ways. You can use the built-in Lightning port on the bottom of the case, a Qi wireless charging pad, or Apple’s MagSafe charging tech. It’s the same magnetic charging tech that’s used in the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13, where Apple uses magnets to line up the pad with the device and hold it in place while it wirelessly charges. </p><p>Another notable addition to the new AirPods is that both the case and the earbuds themselves are IPX4 rated for water and sweat resistance. That doesn’t mean they’re waterproof, but you shouldn’t worry if they get a little damp during a workout. </p><p>The biggest question most people have about the AirPods is whether or not they’ll fit in their ears. The second question is whether or not they’ll stay in their ears.</p><p>For me, the AirPods fit and stayed in without any issues. I’m not a runner, but walking around the block at a decent pace didn’t cause any issues with their fit. Admittedly, everyone’s ears are different, and this may not be the case for you. </p><p>My advice is to give these a try, even if the original AirPods gave you issues. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135471">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135471%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135471/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="More-than-improved-sound-quality-and-battery-life"><a href="#More-than-improved-sound-quality-and-battery-life" class="headerlink" title="More than improved sound quality and battery life"></a>More than improved sound quality and battery life</h2><p>AirPods on a MagSafe charging stand. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>Whenever any company, let alone Apple, releases a new product, the core features almost certainly are improved. For example, the new AirPods promise and deliver on sound quality and longer battery life. For me, there’s a more rounded sound to the 3rd generation AirPods compared to the 2nd generation AirPods; the newest ones appear to have the sound quality of the AirPods Pro. And battery life has gone up, with the new AirPods giving you six hours of listening time, up from five hours on the previous model. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-wireless-charger/"><strong>The best wireless chargers</strong></a></p><p>If you include the charging case in battery life estimates, the 3rd generation AirPods should net you about 30 hours of listening time, up from 24 hours. </p><p>There’s a catch to those battery life claims, though. That 30-hour max is if you use the AirPods with Spatial Audio turned off. Spatial Audio is new to the entry-level AirPods, and it’s a welcomed addition. Previously, Spatial Audio was something only the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max offered. </p><p>When turned on while you’re either watching a compatible video or streaming compatible audio through the Apple Music app, Spatial Audio creates a 3D audio experience that follows your head as you move it. For example, while listening to Post Malone’s song “Circles,” you can turn your head to the right or left, and the audio in your ears changes as you move. It leaves you with the impression that you’re listening to live music directly in front of you. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>Outside of the impact on battery life, the only downside to Spatial Audio is that not all music or videos in the various streaming apps are compatible. So one minute you can be listening to a track that fully supports Spatial Audio, only for the next track to lack support. It’s an odd experience going back and forth, but it’s not a dealbreaker by any means. </p><p>The new AirPods use the same H1 chip that Apple has used in previous AirPods, which enables features like quick pairing, easy device switching, extended range, and longer battery life. It also makes it possible to use the hands-free “Hey Siri” feature to send messages, get weather updates, and interact with the personal assistant just like you would on your iPhone or iPad. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/"><strong>Shopping for an iPhone? Here’s the right model for you</strong></a></p><p>One missing feature that might be a deal-breaker for some is the lack of active-noise cancellation (ANC). That means the 3rd generation AirPods also lack a transparency mode to let in some environmental sounds. For those who don’t consistently need or use ANC, it’s likely to be a non-issue. But during the last few weeks, I’ve found myself wishing they had ANC. Whether it’s blocking the background noise of my kids arguing over who gets the last piece of candy, or the <em>clickety-clack</em> of my mechanical keyboard that randomly gets on my nerves, ANC has become a feature I don’t want to go without. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948937/19272" target="_top" id="1948937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bottom-line"><a href="#Bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom line"></a>Bottom line</h2><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>The 3rd generation $179 AirPods are going to be a hit. Just like the original AirPods, they offer functionality that can’t be matched by the competition, although, many products now come close. </p><p>There’s a lot to like about the latest AirPods. MagSafe isn’t a groundbreaking addition, but it’s something I think most iPhone owners will find themselves using as they add MagSafe chargers to their home or office. The new design looks a lot like AirPods Pro, save for the lack of adaptability. That said, I haven’t had issues with fit or comfort. </p><p>Personally, I’ve missed active-noise cancelation that the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max offer. But most of my use is in a noisy environment where I’ve grown accustomed to background noise being non-existent. </p><p>If you’ve been holding out on upgrading your AirPods for something better, the 3rd generation model is certainly it. If you’re new to AirPods, I can’t think of a better way to start your wireless earbuds experience within Apple’s ecosystem.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-deciphering-highlighted-discussion-threads-for-2024/"><u>[New] Deciphering Highlighted Discussion Threads for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-ffmpeg-and-its-role-in-preserving-natural-auditory-formats/"><u>[New] FFmpeg and Its Role in Preserving Natural Auditory Formats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-keep-up-the-snapstreak-game/"><u>[Updated] How To Keep Up the Snapstreak Game</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/1-how-apple-vision-pro-can-rise-to-the-top-essential-improvements-for-market-triumph-insights/"><u>1.

Although the AirPods 4 with noise cancellation share the same audio chip and features as the Pro 2, the differences in fit completely alter how the earbuds interact with your ears.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014850/22899" target="_top" id="2014850">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014850" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014850/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ZDNET’s-buying-advice"><a href="#ZDNET’s-buying-advice" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET’s buying advice"></a>ZDNET’s buying advice</h2><p>I highly recommend AirPods to people with at least one Apple device, especially an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can use AirPods with non-Apple devices, but you’ll pay for limited functionality.</p><p>If you’re adamant about waiting for the AirPods Pro 3, I understand your thought process, but you’ll be waiting until sometime next year. Thankfully, the new model will be even more advanced, as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman predicts features like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-airpods-pro-3-may-be-your-new-fitness-coach-wtih-a-built-in-heart-rate-sensor/" >a heart-rate sensor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, enhanced audio quality and noise cancellation, and a redesigned case.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-hands-on/" >iPhone 16 Pro hands-on: My 3 favorite things about this ridiculously overpowered supercomputer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If those purported features don’t excite you, the AirPods Pro 2 will do just fine. Keep an eye out for sales; you can frequently find these earbuds for as low as $189, only $10 more than the new AirPods 4 with noise cancellation.</p><p>My only regret regarding my AirPods Pro 2 earbuds is that I paid full price for them. Still, even at full price, they are cheaper (and more advanced) than Sony’s, Bose’s, Google’s, and Samsung’s premium flagship earbuds.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/"  title="20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really">20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/"  title="Want a programming job?

Mobile device repair specialists iFixit <a class="link"   href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/82867/iphone-15-teardown-reveals-software-lockdown" >would later reveal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that repairability was held back a little by Apple’s DRM, but it appears the latest iPhone – the iPhone 16 – addresses those issues.</p><p>First up is a new way to remove the iPhone’s battery. The iPhone 15 and previous models used glue that was notoriously difficult to deal with, but the iPhone 16 has a special adhesive that loosens when you apply a low-voltage charge like a 9V battery, making it significantly easier and faster to remove. This glue is present on the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus, but not the Pro model.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/" >We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But even with all the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >Apple Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> features we know about and considering that Apple will likely reserve new ones to announce during the September 9 event,</p><p>Also new is a Repair Assistant that is included with iOS 18. The feature is open to both repair professionals and regular consumers and allows them to configure parts – both new and used. Apple <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-to-expand-repair-options-with-support-for-used-genuine-parts/" >announced this feature in April <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, saying, “the new process is designed to maintain an iPhone user’s privacy, security, and safety, while offering consumers more options, increasing product longevity, and minimizing the environmental impact of a repair.” </p><p>Apple says used or third-party parts will have the same functionality and security as original ones.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>On-board diagnostics are coming too, letting customers know what part is malfunctioning. Previously, you would have needed another phone to run this tool.</p><p>Finally, Apple is making it easier to replace the Face ID sensor. Previously, only Apple could swap out this part, but now anyone can replace the TrueDepth Camera on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro. <a class="link"   href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reveals-how-its-made-the-iphone-16-series-much-easier-to-repair-120055256.html" >Engadget adds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that the LiDAR scanner is now replaceable too.</p><p>Not only is Apple adding several tools for you to diagnose your phone problems on your own, but it’s significantly widening support for non-Apple parts. IFixIt hasn’t officially revealed the phone’s repairability score, but it should be a big leap from before.</p><h4 id="iPhone"><a href="#iPhone" class="headerlink" title="iPhone"></a>iPhone</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/"  title="The 8 best iPhone models: Which one is right for you?">The 8 best iPhone models: Which one is right for you?

But what reliable ChatGPT alternatives can you turn to when the chatbot is not an option?</p><p>Here are the best ChatGPT alternatives.</p><h2 id="1-Claude-AI"><a href="#1-Claude-AI" class="headerlink" title="1.Claude AI"></a>1.<a class="link"   href="https://claude.ai/" >Claude AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-of-the-claude-ai-chat-interface.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of the Claude AI chat interface"                ></p><p> Claude AI is undoubtedly the best alternative to ChatGPT. In the fast-moving world of AI, that status might change in a few days, weeks, or months, but it is the next best prospect in the AI chatbot space at the time of writing. You’ll be hard-pressed to find an AI chatbot that gets as close to ChatGPT in creativity, common sense reasoning, and accuracy as Claude AI.</p><p> How does it weigh against ChatGPT?<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-claude-ai-chatbot-better-than-chatgpt/" >Claude AI outshines ChatGPT in four key areas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> while comfortably holding its own on several key metrics. It has stricter safety measures, larger context length, a more recent knowledge base, and, it seems, particularly better creative writing tasks.</p><p> You can learn<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/sign-up-claude-ai/" >how to sign up and start using Claude AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . As a rising star in the AI chatbot space, and with a few more iterations, Claude might achieve a true peer status with ChatGPT—or even eventually outperform it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043638/7443" target="_top" id="2043638">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043638" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043638/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Google-Gemini"><a href="#2-Google-Gemini" class="headerlink" title="2.Google Gemini"></a>2.<a class="link"   href="https://bard.google.com/" >Google Gemini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bard-explaining-what-makeuseof-does.jpg"                      alt="Bard explaining what MakeUseOf does"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943750/22993" target="_top" id="1943750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943750/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Another worthy alternative to ChatGPT is Google’s Gemini, formerly Bard AI. After Claude AI, Google’s Gemini is probably the most powerful and widely used ChatGPT alternative that doesn’t rely on OpenAI’s GPT language model. Aptly named, the AI chatbot is currently powered by Google’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/is-google-gemini-better-than-chatgpt/" >Gemini family of large language models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a move away from the poorly performing<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-google-palm-2/" >PaLM 2 large language model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Although Google’s Gemini AI model is similar to OpenAI’s GPT at the architectural level, there is a noticeable difference in the practical capabilities of the two language models. Regardless, Google is always trying to build the capabilities of its chatbot to be on par with ChatGPT. Recently, Gemini has been supercharged with new abilities that enable it to generate stunning AI images, just as ChatGPT currently does.</p><p> While Gemini is quite powerful in its own right, ChatGPT enjoys the advantage of being powered by a model that has undergone several iterations of qualitative improvement. Although we can argue that Google’s rebranded Gemini has gone through a similar pipeline of quality-focused development, it hasn’t really been at the same pace and depth as ChatGPT.</p><p> Notwithstanding, Gemini has improved massively from its early days, now boasting impressive abilities, including experimental audio and video processing abilities that could potentially be a game-changer when fully rolled out. It is a good tool for crafting write-ups like articles and emails and has commendable mathematical abilities. It is also a useful programming aid and quite an effective tool for learning a new language.</p><p> There<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-google-bard/" >are some creative ways to use Google’s Gemini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and if you’re wondering how Gemini stacks up against ChatGPT, take a look at our in-depth analysis<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-google-bard/" >comparing ChatGPT vs. Gemini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="3-Microsoft-Copilot"><a href="#3-Microsoft-Copilot" class="headerlink" title="3.Microsoft Copilot"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/" >Microsoft Copilot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/microsoft-copilot-in-edge-browser-feb-2024.png"                      alt="microsoft copilot in edge browser feb 2024"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137975/21526" target="_top" id="2137975">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137975" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137975/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Microsoft Copilot, formerly Bing AI Chat, is one of the best AI chatbots that uses OpenAI’s GPT-4 technology. Microsoft Copilot blends results from the web, OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, and Microsoft’s proprietary technology to produce factual and up-to-date results for millions of its users worldwide. Like ChatGPT, Copilot can also generate stunning images using the DALL-E image generation model, although the quality of images from Copilot sometimes seems less appealing than those generated from DALL-E on ChatGPT.</p><p> Copilot is intricately tethered to the internet and can provide real-time information about trends and events, which means it provides more relevant responses to prompts “by default” than your regular ChatGPT.</p><p> In addition to using OpenAI’s GPT and DALL-E models, Copilot Chat also benefits from Microsoft’s vast wealth of AI resources, giving it an edge over most of the ChatGPT alternatives on our list. If you want to know how Copilot compares to the much more popular ChatGPT, read through our<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-bing-ai-chatbot/" >ChatGPT vs. Microsoft Copilot comparison <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="4-Perplexity-AI"><a href="#4-Perplexity-AI" class="headerlink" title="4.Perplexity AI"></a>4.<a class="link"   href="https://www.perplexity.ai/" >Perplexity AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/perplexity-pro-account-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="Perplexity pro account screenshot"                ></p><p> Like Microsoft’s Copilot, Perplexity AI is an AI-powered search engine and chatbot that synthesizes real-time web data and knowledge from its underlying AI model to provide accurate and comprehensive answers to user queries. Perplexity is one of the most reliable alternatives to ChatGPT because it is powered by OpenAI’s GPT technology.</p><p> However, unlike other AI chatbots that are simply “powered by GPT” and do nothing unique, Perplexity has a few interesting features you’ll find useful, particularly its ability to regularize GPT data with current information it sources from the internet. Perplexity AI is also great at citing sources in its responses and providing links you might need for further research on a topic. Its free plan is powered by the GPT-3.5 language model, while the Pro plan, priced at $20 per month, is powered by the more powerful GPT-4 language model. Here’s our detailed breakdown of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-plus-vs-perplexity-which-is-best/" >ChatGPT vs. Perplexity AI chatbots <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="5-Pi-AI"><a href="#5-Pi-AI" class="headerlink" title="5.Pi AI"></a>5.<a class="link"   href="https://pi.ai/" >Pi AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshot-of-pi-ai-chatbot.PNG"                      alt="Screenshot of PI AI chatbot"                ></p><p> Some form of conversational AI model powers all the chatbots on our lists. However, Pi, developed by AI startup Inflection, stands out in its unique interpretation of conversational AI. The chatbot might not be the most advanced AI, but it is one of the most interesting when it comes to holding engaging conversations.</p><p> You’ll ask other chatbots questions, and they’ll provide you with a response, and that’s just about that. Pi AI goes the extra mile to make sure that you get the best conversational experience, almost always responding to your queries with a subtle push to keep you engaged in more conversations. It doesn’t have the shiny fancy features you’ll find in other front-runner chatbots like ChatGPT, but it can provide accurate and detailed answers to most of the questions you throw at it. We highly recommend you give it a try whenever you need a chatbot that is interesting to talk to.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144298/7443" target="_top" id="2144298">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144298" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144298/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-OpenAI-GPT-Playground"><a href="#6-OpenAI-GPT-Playground" class="headerlink" title="6.OpenAI GPT Playground"></a>6.<a class="link"   href="https://beta.openai.com/playground" >OpenAI GPT Playground <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/openai-gpt-3-5-playground.jpg"                      alt="OpenAI GPT-3.5 Playground"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136612/26400" target="_top" id="2136612">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136612" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136612/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Even before ChatGPT went viral, there was OpenAI’s GPT Playground, a platform for the public to play with different iterations of OpenAI’s GPT AI models. Unfortunately, the tool didn’t create as much buzz as ChatGPT has. This is partly because of its technical user interface and lack of consumer-focused publicity.</p><p> Ironically, although ChatGPT is getting much of the spotlight, the GPT models available at the Playground are much larger and more powerful than the variants that power ChatGPT. The models you can access at the Playground are undoubtedly one of the most powerful AI language models around.</p><p> ChatGPT is like an iteration of the GPT model used at the Playground, but it has been better streamlined and fine-tuned to be more conversational and human-like in its response. These streamlined models can better understand human intent, provide context-specific answers, and sustain coherent conversations.</p><p> You can picture the Playground as ChatGPT for power users. You can tweak it to do what ChatGPT does and even much more. There are more options and settings to customize the AI model to behave differently. You’ll also likely notice some differences in the responses from ChatGPT and those you get from the Playground, especially if you tweak the available parameters.</p><p> While ChatGPT will refuse to answer questions on some sensitive topics, the Playground model is less likely to refuse to answer questions. If you’d love to get handy with the Playground, here’s a guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-gpt-3-openai-playground/" >how to use the GPT Playground <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="7-Poe-by-Quora"><a href="#7-Poe-by-Quora" class="headerlink" title="7.Poe by Quora"></a>7.<a class="link"   href="http://poe.com/" >Poe by Quora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/poe-ai.jpg"                      alt="Poe AI"                ></p><p> Unlike the other options on our list, Poe by Quora is less of an AI chatbot and more of an AI platform. Poe gives you access to some of the most established AI large language models currently available online. The platform has everything from Google’s PaLM and Gemini, Meta’s Llama, and Anthropic’s Claude to several iterations of OpenAI’s GPT large language models.</p><p> How good is Poe? Well, let’s say the biggest allure of using Poe is its array of choices. You could say Poe is as good as a combination of the chatbots available on the platform. Although you might not get the same quality of service as you’d get when using the individual chatbots directly on their original provider’s platform, you’ll love Poe’s flexibility. Things get much better if you take up Poe’s $20 monthly subscription, which is cost-effective considering the number of AI models at your disposal. In comparison, the same amount gives you access to a ChatGPT Plus subscription for a month.</p><h2 id="8-YouChat"><a href="#8-YouChat" class="headerlink" title="8.YouChat"></a>8.<a class="link"   href="https://you.com/search?q=who+are+you&tbm=youchat" >YouChat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/you-com-august-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="You.com August screenshot"                ></p><p> YouChat, like most ChatGPT alternatives on our list, is powered by a combination of OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 AI models. Its GPT-4 model capabilities are slapped behind a $20 monthly subscription, although you get a few free GPT-4 credits to try out the chatbot. Unless you subscribe to the YouChat Pro plan, your queries should be powered by the slightly older GPT-3.5 series model. This should give you roughly similar results to the capabilities of the free-tier ChatGPT, although with more summarized results that are heavily synthesized with live internet data.</p><p> YouChat has a sleek, colorful interface and is neatly interwoven into You.com’s search engine. As a result, YouChat can act as a search engine that gives you a list of links to indexed web pages relevant to your query. Or, you can get the typical ChatGPT-styled conversational responses for questions. If you are looking for a search engine and a chatbot like ChatGPT rolled into one product, then YouChat is an excellent option.</p><p> Although YouChat uses OpenAI’s GPT models, just like Perplexity AI and Microsoft’s Copliot, it uses proprietary technology to augment the results provided by the underlying GPT model to provide users with up-to-date information.</p><p> Besides a few limitations, YouChat is a simple and powerful ChatGPT alternative that deserves exposure.</p><h2 id="9-Chatsonic"><a href="#9-Chatsonic" class="headerlink" title="9.Chatsonic"></a>9.<a class="link"   href="https://writesonic.com/chat" >Chatsonic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chatsonic-august-2023-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="Chatsonic August 2023 screenshot"                ></p><p> The underlying technology behind ChatGPT (first GPT 3.5, since updated to GPT-4) is the same technology that powers Chatsonic, making it almost as interesting as ChatGPT. Chatsonic goes a step further and builds on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >the abilities of ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> while fixing<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >some of ChatGPT’s limitations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Just like ChatGPT, Chatsonic uses the DALL-E image generation model to create images on command right on the Chatsonic chat interface. Alongside DALL-E, there’s also the option of using Stable Diffusion to create AI art on the Chatsonic platform.</p><p> However, Chatsonic is not all rosy. Although you’ll get freemium access when you sign up, unlike ChatGPT, Chatsonic is mostly a paid service. You get allocated tokens, and once you’re out of tokens, you’ll have to stick with the barebones on offer. Also, compared to ChatGPT, Chatsonic isn’t great with computer codes.</p><p> Compared with Chatsonic, ChatGPT responses are typically significantly more “complete” and better formatted. In several cases, Chatsonic tends to summarize its responses. That might work for some people, but you might not find it useful when you need a long-form response. However, those limitations aside, Chatsonic is exciting and one of the best ChatGPT alternatives.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141684/17092" target="_top" id="2141684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2141684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettide.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141684/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="10-Character-AI"><a href="#10-Character-AI" class="headerlink" title="10.Character.AI"></a>10.<a class="link"   href="https://character.ai/" >Character.AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-of-charcater-ai-website.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of charcater AI website"                ></p><p> Character.AI is precisely what it says in the name—a character-theme AI chatbot that lets you simulate interaction with popular celebrities, historical figures, or movie characters. From political figures like Donald Trump to movie characters like Iron Man’s Tony Stark, Character AI has a large and interesting selection of characters to interact with on the platform.</p><p> We tried out a conversation with Tony Stark about getting an Iron Man-style suit, and it was interesting, immersive, and logical. Character AI impressively reflects the tone and mannerisms of the characters on offer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/conversation-with-tony-stark-on-character-ai.jpg"                      alt="Conversation with Tony Stark on Character ai"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868495/19272" target="_top" id="1868495">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868495" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868495/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Although Character AI is primarily character-themed, you can still get a ChatGPT-style prompt and response interaction using the “Character Assistant” feature on the platform. Although generally impressive, don’t expect ChatGPT-quality responses. That said, Character AI is worth trying out.</p><p> Capitalizing on public interest and hunger for generative AI, startups and tech giants are scrambling to bring ChatGPT-inspired products to the market. Everyone is trying to outdo each other in this high-stakes technology arms race. The goal is simple: develop and release the most capable AI systems, or at least for now, chatbots.</p><p> As companies keep throwing money and muscle at the problem, more capable ChatGPT alternatives will emerge.
