Along with upgrades to include Apple Intelligence compatibility, the iPhone 16 lineup has a new dedicated camera button on the phones to make taking photos and videos easier. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-we-expect-at-apples-iphone-16-event-ai-features-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-more/" >Everything announced at Apple’s iPhone 16 event <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The Camera Control works in landscape or portrait mode with a button on the side of the iPhone. Pressing it once opens the camera app, then pressing it again takes a picture. By pressing down and holding the button, a video will start recording. In addition, you can lightly press the button to show camera functions you can choose from, such as zoom, exposure, or focal lengths, by swiping between the options. Popular apps like Snapchat will be able to utilize the Camera Control button. </p><p>The Camera Control also uses <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-adds-google-lens-like-visual-intelligence-to-the-iphone-16-camera/" >Apple’s Visual Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to let you capture a photo of things around you, like a flyer or a restaurant, and have your iPhone’s AI capability search for it to give you more information – similar to the Google Lens feature found on Android phones. Apple says some of its AI features will begin rolling out in beta next month, with more features coming soon.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max are available to preorder on Friday, Sept. 13, starting at $799, $899, $999, and $1,199, respectively, and officially go on sale Friday, Sept. 20. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/"><strong>The best iPhone models you can buy</strong></a></p><p>While a separate camera button is undoubtedly a unique upgrade to the iPhone 16 series, it’s important to note that you can already use buttons on your iPhone to take a photo.

Many iPhone users have adopted them as their primary gadgets, often taking them everywhere. Speaking personally, my iPhone almost never leaves my side. I stopped taking it into bed simply as a way to make sure I don’t check email obsessively into the night. But I still take it just about everywhere else. </p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nGlyEL5K6Y?si=3KZhTTBvKcPmyS68" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/" >The best iPhones You can find iPhone models directly from Apple starting from $449.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Nothing (with the possible exception of my Apple Watch), and no one, spends more time with me than my iPhone. If you have one, it’s probably similar for you. </p><p>Siri, of course, is almost always there as well. But Siri has her limitations. iPhones with Siri became more capable when iOS 13 added Shortcuts. As <em>ZDNet</em>‘s Adrian Kingsley-Hughes shows, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-siri-to-take-photos-with-your-iphone/" >Siri can’t click the shutter button on the iPhone camera, but a Shortcut can <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>Voice dictation is another voice input mode. This is most often initiated by tapping the little microphone on the onscreen keyboard that shows up whenever you’re entering text on the iPhone. But out of the box, iPhone dictation has its limits. For example, if you want to replace text that was parsed incorrectly, <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208343" >this Apple support note <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> recommends you “double-tap it, tap the microphone button, then say it again, and tap the keyboard button.” That’s not exactly a hands-free solution, and it’s annoying because the new corrected text often begins with a capital letter. </p><p>As it turns out, though, there’s an incredibly powerful voice input mode that’s hidden from most users because it’s turned off by default. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5gTm5KxtQ0?si=onF1rBS2nEM5nLGg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Introducing-Voice-Control"><a href="#Introducing-Voice-Control" class="headerlink" title="Introducing Voice Control"></a>Introducing Voice Control</h2><p>This feature is simply called Voice Control, and before we show you how to enable it, let’s just discuss a few of the things it can do. Let’s start with that replace text issue we looked at in the earlier paragraph. </p><p>Where before, you’d have to use your hand to tap, then click delete, then re-dictate the word, now all you have to do is say “Correct that.” You could also say, “Replace ball park with ball game.” There’s “lower case that,” “upper case that,” “Delete previous sentence,” “Delete next 4 lines,” and more. </p><p>You also gain full device control, including being able to say things like “scroll up,” “scroll down,” “lock screen,” “scroll to top,” “scroll to bottom,” and so much more. There’s no activation keyword or button to press. Just say it, and the phone does it. My absolute favorite is “take a screenshot.” </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/voice-control-iph2c21a3c88/ios" >Voice Control <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is part of the Accessibility options of iOS and iPadOS and is designed for people with disabilities to be able to use the phone’s touch features. As such, Apple has enabled the ability to control every part of the touch interface by voice. They do this by optionally displaying a name or a number on every touchable object or a grid over the entire screen. </p><p>As you can see, each labeling mechanism allows users to identify and verbally “tap” on-screen elements. Each mechanism has its own advantages. You might want to use numbers in one case, names in another, and a grid on something like a graphic where the names and numbers don’t pick up the point where you want to initiate a voice tap.</p><p>Terms like “display grid” and “display grid continuously” turn those features on and off, with the “continuously” parameter used to keep the prompt display visible after an action is completed. </p><p>You can say things like “tap number” or “pan up number”, “swipe left” with an item name, and even “rotate right” and “rotate left” followed by an item name or number. </p><p>To find out what commands work with Voice Control, start by saying, “What can I say?” iMore has an <a class="link"   href="https://www.imore.com/everything-you-can-do-voice-control-iphone-and-ipad" >excellent comprehensive list of all the commands <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Just point your browser there to see all that’s available. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LeKJBWb6Jhk?si=AnViizAPiIT1YCRA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Enabling-Voice-Control-on-your-phone"><a href="#Enabling-Voice-Control-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Enabling Voice Control on your phone"></a>Enabling Voice Control on your phone</h2><p>Not only is Voice Control not turned on by default, but the code that runs Voice Control also isn’t even installed on your phone. Go to the Accessibility menu, scroll down to Voice Control, and flip the toggle to on to enable Voice Control. There will be a slight delay while the code downloads and installs, and then you’ll have complete access to Voice Control. </p><p>You’ll know Voice Control is enabled when there’s a little blue microphone icon at the top of your screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LlYIdWQc-jw?si=ZQ5809CbQGEar0vg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Additional-features"><a href="#Additional-features" class="headerlink" title="Additional features"></a>Additional features</h2><p>You can turn on and off commands Voice Control listens for. That’s in Accessibility-&gt;Voice Control-&gt;Customize Commands. I’ve turned off most of the visual commands but left the very rich dictation editing commands turned on because I use the dictation feature a lot on my iPhone. I also left the scrolling commands on because I’m sometimes working in the workshop with a tool in one hand while reading instructions on the phone with the other. Voice scrolling makes that possible without having to put down the work project.</p><p>One more powerful feature expands the iPhone’s automation capabilities substantially beyond Shortcuts: you can create custom commands. <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210418" >This Apple tech note <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> shows you how. Once created, you can use this custom voice command to do any action or set of actions, including gestures, running a shortcut script, and recording and playing back a sequence of actions. </p><p>Have you used Voice Control before? Were you aware it was a feature of the iPhone? Now that you know it’s available, do you think you’ll be enabling it? If you’ve used it or plan to use it now that you know about it, please feel free to comment below. </p><p><em>You can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

It’s trying to figure out how to use a new hotel’s TV remote. Now you can go remote-free and use your <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-plus-review/" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as a control instead, thanks to a partnership Apple launched Thursday with InterContinental Hotel Group (IHG). </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-airplay-to-tv/" >AirPlay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Apple’s inter-device streaming technology, comes to more than 60 IHG properties in the US, Mexico, and Canada, for a private, secure, and – most importantly – remote-free streaming experience on your hotel room’s TV.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-airplay-to-tv/"><strong>How to stream from your iPhone to your TV using AirPlay</strong></a></p><p>After getting my first look at the feature at the InterContinental New York Times Square, I predict that AirPlay in hotel rooms will be a game changer for frequent business travelers who want to personalize their hotel room stay.</p><p>Nina Raemont&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>For better or for worse, travel takes us out of our apartment or house and plops us in a hotel room that doesn’t feel like a home: The hotel room’s TV doesn’t have our favorite shows or our watch history loaded onto it already, and we don’t have easy connectivity to a sound system to unwind to our favorite tunes after a long day. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>With IHG’s AirPlay, guests can use their iPhone or iPad camera to scan the “Connect and Stream” QR code on the hotel’s LG TV, which brings them to a Wi-Fi connectivity page where they connect to the room’s network. An AirPlay icon will pop up on the top of the phone or iPad screen. After that, the guest turns on screen mirroring for the connected device, which will load content from their device onto the TV. I tried it out myself, and it was a nearly seamless connection process. </p><p>From there, you can review the photos you’ve taken on your trip, get right back into that show you’re binging, rehearse for that big presentation you flew across the country to give, or play your favorite songs on the TV’s sound system – no remote needed. It could be a business tripper’s best friend to make their hotel room and tech feel more homey during those long stays in foreign cities. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-tv/"><strong>The best TVs to buy: Expert tested</strong></a></p><p>Streaming shows or music is easy, but one app that works especially well with AirPlay is the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/10-ways-apple-plans-to-revolutionize-health-tracking-according-to-a-report/" >Apple Health <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app. If you want to exercise in your hotel room you can go to the Health app’s Fitness+ tab to follow guided workout or meditation sessions on the hotel TV. And your <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >Apple Watch’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> health data rings can be projected onto the corner of the TV as well, in tandem with your phone. Other apps, like Keynote for rehearsing presentations and Photos for reviewing the pictures you took that day, work wonderfully on the TV. </p><p>AirPlay is available in select hotels – including some Holiday Inn, Avid, Candlewood, Crowne Plaza, and InterContinental locations – starting Thursday, with more being added in the coming months. </p><h4 id="Apple"><a href="#Apple" class="headerlink" title="Apple"></a>Apple</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-hands-on/"  title="iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you&#39;ll get">iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you’ll get <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ios-18-settings-i-changed-immediately-and-why-you-should-too/"  title="6 iOS 18 settings I changed immediately -

As expected, Apple today announced a series of updates to VisionOS. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/live-updates-everything-apple-announced-at-wwdc-2024-including-ios-18-siri-ai-more/" >Everything Apple announced at WWDC 2024, including iOS 18, Siri, AI, and more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Did they improve the overall quality of life and usability of Apple’s most quixotic moonshot? I’ll tell you this: Apple only addressed two of the ten items I asked for. On the other hand, Apple did announce a bunch of additional features. I’ll discuss them here in the order Apple presented them during the keynote.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Turn-2D-images-into-spatial-photos"><a href="#1-Turn-2D-images-into-spatial-photos" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn 2D images into spatial photos"></a>1. Turn 2D images into spatial photos</h2><p>I’ve never been terribly impressed by Apple’s implementation of spatial photos, which are photos that have a 3D feel to them. The little square box and the fairly minimal lens separation of the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> resulted in something that seems more novelty than noteworthy. </p><p>Now, Apple has announced that it’s using machine learning to derive a left eye and right eye’s view of all your 2D photos, allowing you to view your flat photos as if they were 3D images. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-get-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/" >Every iPhone model that will get Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones won’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Now, here’s the thing. I tried watching a couple of Marvel 3D movies via Disney+ on the Vision Pro. All the Marvel movies were filmed in 2D and digitally remastered into 3D movies. The 3D effect is pretty underwhelming. Sometimes an object seems to be pulled from the background, but otherwise, it’s not much to write home about. </p><p>I’m guessing that Apple’s 3Difying of a 2D image will be at about the same level. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Sj2QNA-JXI?si=V-_h73iE3VlE214k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Watch-those-images-together-using-SharePlay-in-the-Photos-app"><a href="#2-Watch-those-images-together-using-SharePlay-in-the-Photos-app" class="headerlink" title="2.

Now, if you have multiple Vision Pro users, they can all see and discuss the same image together while using the Photos app. </p><p>So, yeah, if Grandma Sadie in Seattle has a Vision Pro, Cousin Marty in Miami has a Vision Pro, and you have a Vision Pro in Yuma, you can all stand around the virtual photo screen and ooh and ah over pictures of baby Alice. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aoMiYpYiFZs?si=qvYvGytDD17fvSXO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Gestures-for-opening-Home-View-and-Control-Center"><a href="#3-Gestures-for-opening-Home-View-and-Control-Center" class="headerlink" title="3.

Gestures for opening Home View and Control Center</h2><p>While it’s easy enough to open Vision Pro’s home view (the field of app icons) by pressing the Digital Crown on the top of the unit, getting to Control Center is a pain. VisionOS puts a tiny little arrow waaay up at the top of the viewing space, and you have to glance at it and tap your fingers together to get it to open. </p><p>In VisionOS 2, there are gestures. Holding your hand palm up and tapping fingers opens the app view. Flipping your hand over will give you time and battery level. A finger tap in this position will open up Control Center. </p><p>Unlike the previous two features, this <em>is</em> a quality of life improvement. </p><h2 id="4-Mac-virtual-display-improvements"><a href="#4-Mac-virtual-display-improvements" class="headerlink" title="4. Mac virtual display improvements"></a>4. Mac virtual display improvements</h2><p>The Mac virtual display feature of the Vision Pro has been nice, but limited. In VisionOS 1, you could only show one 4K display. Personally, I’m waiting for Apple to ditch the entire display paradigm and just show windows, but that’s not going to happen this year. </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>On the other hand, Apple “later this year” will enable you to create displays with more resolutions. The most interesting is the full wrap-around display, which will be the equivalent of two 4K monitors. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uzb-0C0xUYA?si=F4MPhdVqyVgx7_8X" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Choo-choo-train-mode"><a href="#5-Choo-choo-train-mode" class="headerlink" title="5.

We’ve <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/itching-to-try-vision-pros-travel-mode-heres-what-to-expect-before-you-go/" >talked about the Vision Pro’s travel mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was mostly intended for airplane travel. </p><p>In VisionOS 2, Apple is announcing that there is dedicated support in travel mode for train travel. We know <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8ckKAjAWLw8" >people have already been successful using the Vision Pro on the train and even subway <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but in this case, Apple presumably tweaked performance somewhat. </p><h2 id="6-New-developer-APIs"><a href="#6-New-developer-APIs" class="headerlink" title="6. New developer APIs"></a>6. New developer APIs</h2><p>There are a ton of VR and AR APIs in Apple’s platforms. But this week, at WWDC, Apple is showcasing three new APIs developers can use to gain access to Apple technology. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-visionos-18-things-developers-need-to-know-about-coding-for-apple-vision-pro/" >Inside VisionOS: 18 things developers need to know about coding for Apple Vision Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Volumetric API:</strong> Allows complex 3D apps to run side-by-side. A volumetric API is at the core of most 3D content, because it allows developers to create, manage, and present volumetric content. My read on this announcement is not the introduction of a Volumetric API, but that it can allow multiple 3D apps to run concurrently.</li><li><strong>TabletopKit:</strong> Helps developers create apps that anchor to flat surfaces. One obvious example is board game kits, but this could apply to interior design apps, architectural and construction projects, gaming, navigation, and more.</li><li><strong>Enterprise APIs:</strong> These were described as enterprise-specific APIs, so we can assume they’re somewhat special purpose. Examples given were surgical training and manufacturing.</li></ul><h2 id="7-New-Canon-spatial-lens-for-creating-spatial-video"><a href="#7-New-Canon-spatial-lens-for-creating-spatial-video" class="headerlink" title="7. New Canon spatial lens for creating spatial video"></a>7. New Canon spatial lens for creating spatial video</h2><p>While iPhone 15 Pro users can create spatial video, there are limitations to using an iPhone as a camera. Apple announced today that Canon will be introducing a spatial lens for its <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Canon-RF-S18-150mm-Mirrorless-Processor-Detection/dp/B0B2KSD7WW/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cbfbe271d-4f99-40f4-b81e-3b3c556a641c%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >EOS R7 digital camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>This allows more commercial and prosumer projects where the photographer or videographer needs more control over the complex range of settings available in a more traditional camera. Those videos can then be edited in Final Cut Pro, Apple’s only mention of Final Cut during WWDC. There’s also a new Vimeo app for VisionOS, that will allow spatial videos to be shared. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gkdZ3A1mock?si=2zeR5GtTU2VujM_w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Third-party-immersive-video-workflow"><a href="#8-Third-party-immersive-video-workflow" class="headerlink" title="8. Third-party immersive video workflow"></a>8. Third-party immersive video workflow</h2><p>One of the truly breathtaking experiences of the Vision Pro is what Apple calls Immersive video. This is a very big step beyond the typical 3D video we’ve seen in movies and TV shows. The entire experience wraps around you 180 degrees. When it’s done right, it’s astonishing. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-watched-apples-newest-immersive-video-on-the-vision-pro-and-it-was-my-aha-moment/" >I watched Apple’s newest Immersive Video on the Vision Pro, and it was my ‘aha’ moment <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple is opening up the format for third-party creators to create immersive video. The approach is to use cameras and DaVinci Resolve Studio from <a class="link"   href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/" >Blackmagic Design <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. There’s no doubt that Blackmagic makes excellent gear and that DaVinci Resolve is a fine application. It’s just a little surprising that Apple didn’t bake this capability into its own high-end video production tool, Final Cut Pro.</p><p>Even so, I think this is great. Those immersive videos are fantastic. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASUEYpqSP5E?si=0KOZxrTVexTuUkRn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Other-new-features"><a href="#Other-new-features" class="headerlink" title="Other new features"></a>Other new features</h2><p>Apple didn’t cover all the new features during its announcement. At the end of the Vision Pro segment, the company put up one of its feature grid graphics (shown at the beginning of this article). Here are a few that weren’t mentioned: </p><ul><li><strong>Mouse support:</strong> I mentioned this in my wishlist. Apple’s presenters didn’t mention it, but it’s on that grid of features. Hurray!</li><li><strong>Keyboard breakthrough:</strong> This was another feature I felt it was important for Apple to introduce, and apparently it will be available. No mention was made of it, so we have no idea if it’s limited solely to Apple’s own keyboards (but that’s probably the case).</li><li><strong>Bora Bora environment:</strong> I wanted to see more environments and we get…one. Personally, I think all the work on spatial photos and spatial videos could have been replaced with the ability for third parties to create 3D environments, but Apple didn’t go there. But hey, Bora Bora, right?</li><li><strong>Rearrangeable Home View:</strong> This was also not described but I’m guessing this means you can move around the Home icons.</li></ul><h2 id="What-do-you-think"><a href="#What-do-you-think" class="headerlink" title="What do you think?"></a>What do you think?</h2><p>I’ll admit, I’m fairly underwhelmed. I definitely would have thought there would be a bunch of new environments (at least one or two indoors), as well as third-party options. </p><p>Apple did announce that more than 2,000 apps were built specifically for the Vision Pro and more than 1.5 million iPad apps are compatible. But I’m still surprised that Apple didn’t create spatial versions of its remaining non-spatial apps (i.e., Books, Calendar, Clock, Home, Maps, Podcasts, Reminders, Shortcuts, Stocks, and Voice Memos). </p><p>And, I’m shocked that Find My support is still missing from VisionOS (or at least wasn’t mentioned). </p><p>What do you think? Is VisionOS 2 enough to get us through another year of this astoundingly expensive device? Is there anything in VisionOS 2 that wasn’t in VisionOS 1 that would inspire you now to go out and buy one? If you have a Vision Pro, will any of these features improve your quality of life? Let us know in the comments below. </p><hr><p><em>You can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

Considering the buzz about the chatbot’s errors, however, it’s easy to wonder whether the AI is reliably accurate.</p><p> Can ChatGPT solve math problems? While it’s impossible for the AI-powered tool to solve every problem correctly one hundred percent of the time, it’s important to have an idea of just how accurate the AI is. There’s no better way to test ChatGPT than directly subjecting it to a variety of math problems.</p><h2 id="Can-ChatGPT-Solve-Arithmetic-and-Algebra-Problems"><a href="#Can-ChatGPT-Solve-Arithmetic-and-Algebra-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Can ChatGPT Solve Arithmetic and Algebra Problems?"></a>Can ChatGPT Solve Arithmetic and Algebra Problems?</h2><p> Before attempting to have ChatGPT solve any complex problems, it’s important to determine whether it understands the fundamentals. One user went viral for finding that ChatGPT would respond with eight when asked what five plus two equals—but as time passes, it’s likely that such basic errors have been fixed.</p><p> You can ask ChatGPT questions by navigating to the OpenAI website. Before you go any further, it’s important to note that you should<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/which-version-of-chatgpt-should-you-use/" >use the best version of ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —GPT-4—if you want the most accurate results. The free version, GPT-3.5, is suitable for most users, however.</p><p> To start testing ChatGPT, it was subjected to problems involving PEMDAS, fractions, and decimals.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/arithmetic-1.jpg"                      alt="asking chatgpt to solve 8 divided by 1 plus 3"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/arithmetic-2.jpg"                      alt="asking chatgpt to solve 5 divided by 6 minus 2 divided by 8"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNhKhWc0wLc?si=1XLYV0sXV52Xc0lu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/arithmetic-3.jpg"                      alt="Asking chatgpt to solve 1.195 minus 1.128"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hS27nZVi9Y?si=_Zqj_l4a4XkPqT2S" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/arithmetic-4-1.jpg"                      alt="asking chatgpt to solve 2.98 minus 4 divided by 13"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPAKth3O_5c?si=M69YSY0Mk_gsdU0Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> Pleasantly, ChatGPT was able to solve all the arithmetic problems given to it correctly within seconds. It showed proficiency with topics like PEMDAS and decimals, and supplied explanations without prompting. When asked to explain how it divided four by thirteen to someone unfamiliar with long division, it provided an adequately detailed overview of the steps.</p><p> Next, the test continued with ChatGPT pitted against three problems in Algebra—in this case, testing its familiarity with linear equations, arithmetic sequences, geometric sequences, and quadratic equations. As seen with arithmetic, GPT-4 managed to solve all the problems without error.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/algebra-1.jpg"                      alt="asking chatgpt to solve for the slope intercept and point slope form of y divided by 4 equals 6 plus 2 times x"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/algebra-2.jpg"                      alt="asking chatgpt to solve for the distance a ball bounces into the air on the seventh bounce given an initial height of ten feet with each successive bounce rising to 75 percent of the previous height"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/algebra-3.jpg"                      alt="asking chatgpt to solve the bouncing ball problem as a geometric sequence"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/97ydpSmzTJw?si=tFcelmtQX4u-b3u5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/algebra-4.jpg"                      alt="asking chatgpt to solve a quadratic equation where x squared plus six times x plus 8 equals zero"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="Can-ChatGPT-Solve-Geometry-and-Trigonometry-Problems"><a href="#Can-ChatGPT-Solve-Geometry-and-Trigonometry-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Can ChatGPT Solve Geometry and Trigonometry Problems?"></a>Can ChatGPT Solve Geometry and Trigonometry Problems?</h2><p> Seeing as ChatGPT was able to solve arithmetic and algebra problems without error, the challenge proceeded with a few problems in geometry and trigonometry. Despite being faced with a few topics in trig—including the Pythagorean theorem, inscribed angles, and the directrix of a parabola—GPT-4 solved all problems accurately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/geometry-1.jpg"                      alt="asking chatgpt to solve for the hypotenuse of a triangle"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/geometry-2.jpg"                      alt="asking chatgpt to solve for an angle given a three sided shape inscribed within a triangle"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/geometry-3.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt makes a mistake in the inscribed angle problem after being asked for an explanation"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GU08CQVsZz0?si=V-SvPfzRsQysMS0e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/geometry-4.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt solves for the equation of a parabola given the focus and vertex"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ECz3oZ8NrQ?si=86vkwkDJo9HQXpzt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><p> Interestingly, ChatGPT was exceedingly quick to walk back its confident response to the inscribed angle problem as soon as it was asked for an explanation. This is even though it was plainly stated that points A, B, and C all lie on the circumference of the circle, with the clear implication that the inscribed angle theorem would apply to the problem.</p><p> In fact, it contradicted the information given that “all three points are along the circumference of the circle” by suggesting that AB and BC intersect within the circle.</p><p> Essentially, you don’t have to purposefully pressure ChatGPT into giving wrong answers—a brief prompt for explanation was enough to make ChatGPT offer an incorrect answer as appeasement. Unfortunately,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >wrong answers aren’t the only issue with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , either.</p><p> As with geometry and the topics before it, ChatGPT was able to solve trigonometry problems relating to topics like sinusoidal equations, amplitude, and the sine of complementary angles with ease. When given an incorrect premise in the fourth equation, however, ChatGPT was just as willing to offer a confidently incorrect answer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/trig-1.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt solves for x given a cosine equation where 16 times the cosine of 12 times x plus eight equals negative eight"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/trig-2.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt solves for the amplitude of a waveform given the minimum value and midpoint of an equation"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/trig-3.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt solves for the cosine and sine of the interior angle of a right triangle"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/trig-4.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt gives an incorrect definition of sine after user insists that it is incorrect"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="Can-ChatGPT-Solve-Calculus-Problems"><a href="#Can-ChatGPT-Solve-Calculus-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Can ChatGPT Solve Calculus Problems?"></a>Can ChatGPT Solve Calculus Problems?</h2><p> Finally, ChatGPT’s abilities to solve calculus problems were tested with a simple limit problem and a question about derivatives. Its logical reasoning capabilities and ability to withstand unreasonable criticism were also tested.</p><p> Previous mistakes by ChatGPT didn’t inspire confidence regarding whether it would stand by correct answers or eventually submit to forceful but wrong thinking.</p><p> As seen before, ChatGPT’s primary susceptibility was to user error. It successfully solved for the limit as x approached 0, and it just as readily solved for the limit as x approached 2 when corrected.</p><p> ChatGPT originally offered the correct solution for the derivative g’(1) given that g(x) was the inverse function of f(x), but it quickly amended its answer to be incorrect when given a vague rejection instead of standing by its solution.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/calc-1.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt solves for the limit of an equation correctly"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/calc-2.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt solves for the value of the derivative of an inverse function"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oB9V7rZzotw?si=d4xrCbq1jKHXGAWN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/calc-3.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt offers a correct answer for the derivative of an inverse of a function"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/calc-4.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt gives an incorrect answer after being told its original correct answer was erroneous"                ></p><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq2r4ZKM-Po?si=fA2DdEB1op-atCkz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-ChatGPT-Accurate-at-Solving-Math-Problems"><a href="#Is-ChatGPT-Accurate-at-Solving-Math-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Is ChatGPT Accurate at Solving Math Problems?"></a>Is ChatGPT Accurate at Solving Math Problems?</h2><p> Overall, ChatGPT is accurate at solving math problems. It is highly capable of answering and explaining questions from a broad assortment of topics in math. The main issue that ChatGPT faces is that it isn’t as capable of correcting false assumptions and misunderstandings—and in some cases, it can affirm mistakes without being prompted to do so.</p><p> That doesn’t make ChatGPT a bad tool for solving math problems. In many cases, ChatGPT serves as a reliable and accurate time-saver—and it’s completely free to use. The mistakes made by ChatGPT don’t condemn it, but they do serve as a reminder that you need to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-get-best-results-from-chatgpt/" >use the right techniques when working with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and double-check its answers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rBnnLFJbvr4?si=LlHYrYlOBp7NLMec" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT’s-Equation-Solving-Limitations"><a href="#ChatGPT’s-Equation-Solving-Limitations" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT’s Equation Solving Limitations"></a>ChatGPT’s Equation Solving Limitations</h2><p> ChatGPT doesn’t appear to have any significant limitations in solving math problems, but there are a few rules you should keep in mind as you work with it.</p><ul><li>ChatGPT 3.5 cannot work with images. As it is extremely difficult to describe images accurately, you may find that attempting to explain a problem to ChatGPT that relies on images only leads to errors. You should consider using GPT-4 if you need to use images.</li><li>ChatGPT always answers confidently. If you aren’t familiar enough with math to discern when it gives an incorrect answer but rely on it for learning, you may develop serious misunderstandings about concepts in math over time.</li><li>ChatGPT bends to the will of the user. Regardless of whether you intend to manipulate its answers, it may offer incorrect information to appease you if something in your response triggers it.</li><li>ChatGPT may not pick up on inherent errors in the information that you give it. You should reconsider using ChatGPT for math if you aren’t familiar enough with a concept because it may simply reinforce your misunderstanding.</li></ul><h2 id="Use-ChatGPT-Carefully-When-Solving-Math-Problems"><a href="#Use-ChatGPT-Carefully-When-Solving-Math-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Use ChatGPT Carefully When Solving Math Problems"></a>Use ChatGPT Carefully When Solving Math Problems</h2><p> It’s clear that ChatGPT has an impressive ability to solve math problems ranging from arithmetic to calculus. ChatGPT can be used as a powerful study tool, but it should be used carefully—after all, you’ll only be able to easily identify when it makes errors by developing your math skills enough to double-check its work.</p><p> Rather put the AI-powered chatbot to other uses?

Experian reports that this makes Apple the first major buy now, pay later (BNPL) service provider to directly give the credit reporting agency loan information and payment history. </p><p>Loans borrowed today will appear on the borrower’s Experian credit report with a BNPL designation starting on March 1, but this data won’t affect credit scores – at least not initially. According to Experian, the information won’t be considered in traditional credit scoring as we know it, but it will likely affect future scoring models.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/finance/taxes/best-tax-software/" >The best tax software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple confirms that Apple Pay Later loan information in Experian credit reports includes a soft credit inquiry that won’t impact the applicant’s credit score and payment history. </p><p>“We designed Apple Pay Later with our users’ financial health in mind, and an important part of this is ensuring that their loans are reflected in their overall financial profiles,” Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, said in a statement. “By reporting Apple Pay Later loans to Experian, we aim to help promote greater transparency and responsible lending for both the borrower and the lender while allowing users to further build their credit.”</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Including these BNPL loans in credit reporting can give consumers a more accurate and comprehensive view of their financial behavior, which can benefit both lenders and borrowers. </p><p>For companies like Apple, for which these BNPL loans serve as financial products, reporting its Apple Pay Later loans to credit bureaus helps align this product to traditional credit products and encourages legitimacy and transparency. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-the-best-mint-alternatives-and-this-is-my-new-favorite-budgeting-app-now/" >I tested the best Mint alternatives, and this is my new favorite budgeting app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>“Experian has long supported the use of expanded data sources, including BNPL information, to help consumers build their credit profile and improve their financial health,” said Jennifer Schulz, CEO of Experian North America. “We applaud Apple for taking this meaningful first step and look forward to working with other leading BNPL providers to drive greater transparency that will benefit lenders and consumers alike.”</p><p>As consumer spending habits and credit use evolve, as has happened with the proliferation of BNPL loans in recent years, so do credit scoring models.

That’s a particular challenge, because the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apples-vision-pro-price-features-hands-on-insights-and-everything-you-need-to-know/" >Vision Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vr-headset/" >any XR experience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) can’t be easily represented in the 2D world most of us work in. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-vision-pro-review/?ftag=TRE-03-10aaa6b&utm_email=8850ada83866fe2b042041f6277c004e9a68ab834781629d69b19700d29270fc&utm_campaign_id=9079333&utm_email_id=b34faa57a90996e0022de8d6c16f2c69c20f8d362fcf0e3750a9d0edd0939119&utm_newsletter_id=92303&medium=email&source=iterable" >Apple Vision Pro review: Fascinating, flawed, and needs to fix 5 things <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>What you see on your flat screen – whether they’re screenshots or recorded videos – will be substantially different from what one sees inside the Vision Pro’s secluded environment. That said, Apple’s VisionOS does offer both screenshot and screen recording capabilities, and since those are the tools we have to communicate to the 2D world, they’re the tools we’ll be using. </p><p>In this article, I’ll show you how to take both screenshots and screen recordings. I’ll also showcase some interesting spatial computing artifacts of that process. Let’s dive in. </p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zWYVKFk3yPQ?si=Yu7xsjIYgRiq8zHk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-take-a-screenshot-or-screen-recording-with-your-Vision-Pro"><a href="#How-to-take-a-screenshot-or-screen-recording-with-your-Vision-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to take a screenshot or screen recording with your Vision Pro"></a>How to take a screenshot or screen recording with your Vision Pro</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5EKBEujWCw4?si=PwVvvervi8OrYaEA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-two-ways-to-take-a-screenshot-on-Vision-Pro"><a href="#The-two-ways-to-take-a-screenshot-on-Vision-Pro" class="headerlink" title="The two ways to take a screenshot on Vision Pro"></a>The two ways to take a screenshot on Vision Pro</h2><p>You have two options for how to take a screenshot. The first, which is useful if you can stabilize your head before taking a shot, is to press both the top button and the digital crown simultaneously. </p><p>David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Once you do that, you’ll hear an old-fashioned camera shutter sound, and a 1920x1080 image will be dropped into your Photos stream. </p><p>Here’s an example: </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>I prefer the second way, which is simply to ask Siri to take the shot. All you have to do is say “Siri, take screenshot,” and the AI will handle the rest. I prefer this second method because – if I have my head and view exactly where I want it – I don’t have to move my body, arms, and potentially the display to press the buttons. Doing so could change the view from the image I wanted to take. </p><p>So that’s how it’s done. Now for the weird part.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JMgRzDANfSQ?si=NDy01ntXGGOi1Uxs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-handle-screenshot-weirdness-on-Vision-Pro"><a href="#How-to-handle-screenshot-weirdness-on-Vision-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to handle screenshot weirdness on Vision Pro"></a>How to handle screenshot weirdness on Vision Pro</h2><p>With only one example, you might not have noticed a weirdness that’s super-apparent in other screenshots. Look at this example of two ZDNET pages side-by-side: </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Notice how much more clear my article is than the page on the left. Here’s another image of my article. This time, notice how much more clear the area in blue is, compared to the area in red. </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>This is not a mistake. It’s actually how the Vision Pro renders its screen. Those blurry screen areas are what’s projected to the wearer. When using the device, the effect is not that noticeable. </p><p>That’s because the Vision Pro relies heavily on eye tracking. Not only is eye tracking used as a pointing mechanism in the UI, but it’s also used to tell the Vision Pro what to render completely and what it can use less processing power to present. </p><p>In the first image above, even though I had two web pages on the screen, I was looking at my article. As such, the front page of ZDNET was only in my peripheral vision, and the Vision Pro knew it could slack on quality because I wasn’t paying attention to it. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/3-apple-vision-pro-mistakes-you-should-avoid-at-all-costs-or-youll-lose-everything/" >3 Apple Vision Pro mistakes you should avoid at all costs (or you’ll lose everything) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Likewise, in the second image, I was looking at the text I’ve highlighted as the blue area. Because I wasn’t focused directly on the text I’ve highlighted as the red areas, the Vision Pro knew it could get away with devoting less processing power to render those sections of the image. </p><p>My operational tip from this observation is simple: Be sure to focus on the part of the screen that you want to showcase when you’re taking a screenshot. That will make that area more crisp. </p><p>Now, here’s a second weirdness I experienced. Take a look at the bottom row of this screenshot: </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Here’s that row after I brought it into Photoshop and cropped it so you can see it better: </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>On the left, you can see the blurring behavior we just discussed. Now, notice how all the screenshots of the Photos library are tilted one way or another? That’s because I had one heck of a hard time trying to capture a screenshot of the web page without the tilt. </p><p>I carefully lined up the horizon of the lake (I’m using the Mount Hood environment) so it was level. And yet, try after try, I could not get a level image. Finally, the far right one turned out to be mostly level, but I felt like my head was tilted quite far to the right. I also couldn’t capture a second image that didn’t tilt. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/could-the-apple-vision-pro-make-you-like-flying-economy-class-or-hate-it-a-little-less/" >Could the Apple Vision Pro make you like flying economy class (or hate it a little less)? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>It’s quite frustrating, and either an artifact of the Vision Pro or of my slightly tilted psyche. Either way, it’s weird and annoying. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2MlLvGxMwI?si=q_blGjXyJrGtzT8d" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-capture-a-screen-recording-on-Vision-Pro"><a href="#How-to-capture-a-screen-recording-on-Vision-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to capture a screen recording on Vision Pro"></a>How to capture a screen recording on Vision Pro</h2><p>To initiate a screen recording, look up to the top of the screen until you see the Control Center dot. Focus on that and click. On the Vision Pro, a click is made by tapping your fingers together. Whenever I say “click,” from here on in, I am referring to that process of tapping your fingers together. (Because constantly repeating “tapping your fingers together” would get really old, really fast. </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>VisionOS will bring up the Control Center. This should be familiar to anyone who’s used iOS before. Because we’ve been talking about screenshots, you should know that I’ve used Photoshop to crop each screenshot, rotate it to make it fairly level, and resize it to 1920x1080. When using Vision Pro screenshots to illustrate something, I’ll always tweak them in Photoshop for the best learning potential. </p><p>In any case, to begin a recording, press the screen recording button: </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Now, close the Control Center by glancing at the X and clicking. Go ahead and do all the actions you want to appear in the recording. When you’re done, look back up at the top of the screen for the recording dot, which is now green. Click it to end your recording. </p><p>VisionOS will present a dialog telling you your recording has been saved, and it will be in your Photos library. </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Recordings, like screenshots, are only 1080p despite the device itself having a resolution of 3660×3200 per eye. This is what I mean by recordings and screen captures not doing the device justice. Not only is the Vision Pro capable of rendering a 3D environment, but it’s doing so in a far higher resolution than screenshots and recordings can convey. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-order-apple-vision-pro-tips-tricks-and-my-secret-to-a-good-face-scan/" >How to order Apple Vision Pro: Tips, tricks, and my secret to a good face scan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In any case, if you want to see a sample recording, here’s an unedited version of one I did while writing this article. If you watch it, you’ll also see that I’m still having quite a bit of difficulty picking up and moving windows in the Vision Pro. I’m sure that will resolve itself with practice. I’ve only been able to use this device for a little over a day.</p><p>As you can see, I had problems with tilt here as well. My recommendation is to do a test shot and figure out how you have to hold your head. Also, I think I moved my head too fast for the recording. When recording, try to move your head much more slowly than you think necessary. This will prevent 2D video viewers from experiencing disorientation and nausea while watching. </p><p>So there you go.

Well, you’re too late.</p><p> OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has officially revealed that sign-ups for the leading generative AI tool are closed—at least, they are for now. However, with no specific time frame set for when ChatGPT sign-ups will resume, it’s anyone’s guess as to how long potential new users will have to wait.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LlVkEwpjKKo?si=hXi-mchMaJvbnIzM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Are-ChatGPT-Sign-Ups-Closed"><a href="#Why-Are-ChatGPT-Sign-Ups-Closed" class="headerlink" title="Why Are ChatGPT Sign-Ups Closed?"></a>Why Are ChatGPT Sign-Ups Closed?</h2><p> ChatGPT has experienced an enormous surge in usage since OpenAI’s ChatGPT Dev Day on November 6, 2023.</p><p> OpenAI used its Dev Day to reveal the latest round of updates to ChatGPT,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpts-latest-update-explained/" >including GPT-4 Turbo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , an upgraded LLM, and its<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-use-create-a-gpt-to-create-a-customized-version-of-chatgpt/" >new custom GPTs option <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Both have proved instant hits with existing users, and with social media feeds chocked full of exciting ChatGPT content, more people than ever want a piece of the AI pie.</p><p> The sudden uptick in users exploring the new tools and people jumping to use ChatGPT placed considerable strain on OpenAI’s servers—leading the company to close its subscriptions until the situation is under control.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDUPd69Qfls?si=uIGZG-riskwmVZYg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="When-Will-ChatGPT-Subscriptions-Open-Again"><a href="#When-Will-ChatGPT-Subscriptions-Open-Again" class="headerlink" title="When Will ChatGPT Subscriptions Open Again?"></a>When Will ChatGPT Subscriptions Open Again?</h2><p> Currently, there is no official information regarding ChatGPT sign-up reopening. OpenAI’s hardware has been taking a pounding, and there are more than a few existing subscribers expressing discontent about the diminishing service.</p><p> Slower processing times, periodic downtime, blackouts, and more have seen a considerable uptick since the November 6 event. For those who have rapidly integrated ChatGPT and generative AI into workflows and elsewhere, any downtime is keenly felt.</p><p> However, despite ChatGPT subscriptions being closed, it won’t take them long to reopen. Each day ChatGPT’s doors remain closed to new users is lost revenue for OpenAI, and that’s a situation no business wants to be in—even if the problem is caused by its enormous success.</p><p> If you want to be first in the queue when ChatGPT subscriptions resume, head to the<a class="link"   href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login?ref=upstract.com" >ChatGPT Sign-Up page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , enter your details and await an email.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HMuxjTCMX2E?si=ylRTMJuUstpjLsZc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT-Is-a-Victim-of-Its-Own-Success"><a href="#ChatGPT-Is-a-Victim-of-Its-Own-Success" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Is a Victim of Its Own Success"></a>ChatGPT Is a Victim of Its Own Success</h2><p> As said above, it’s an issue any startup founder wants. But when so many people have integrated or come to rely on the service, ensuring the stability and performance of ChatGPT for existing users is just as important as onboarding more subscribers.</p><p>Still, it certainly won’t be long until it changes.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-evolved-look-of-sony-bdp-s6700/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Evolved Look of Sony BDP-S6700</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-blueprint-for-branding-success-on-snapchat/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Ultimate Blueprint for Branding Success on SnapChat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-satire-skills-video-comedy-mastery-tips-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Satire Skills Video Comedy Mastery Tips for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/boost-your-creativity-how-chatgpt-can-assist-in-crafting-a-storybook/"><u>Boost Your Creativity: How ChatGPT Can Assist in Crafting a Storybook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/cook-smartly-and-eat-well-can-chatgpt-become-your-personal-diet-coach/"><u>Cook Smartly and Eat Well: Can ChatGPT Become Your Personal Diet Coach?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/deciphering-the-complexity-behind-controlling-ai-systems/"><u>Deciphering the Complexity Behind Controlling AI Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/decoding-gptbot-insights-into-the-advanced-ai-system-and-its-exclusion-from-certain-websites-explained/"><u>Decoding GPTBot - Insights Into the Advanced AI System & Its Exclusion From Certain Websites Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/demystifying-ai-unveiling-transfer-learning-mechanisms/"><u>Demystifying AI: Unveiling Transfer Learning Mechanisms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/discovering-claude-3-features-and-uses/"><u>Discovering Claude 3: Features & Uses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/duplicitous-chrome-app-thieves-of-social-media-login/"><u>Duplicitous Chrome App: Thieves of Social Media Login</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/easy-steps-to-overcome-the-six-typical-auto-gpt-installation-problems-youll-encounter/"><u>Easy Steps to Overcome the Six Typical Auto-GPT Installation Problems You'll Encounter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-upgrade-apple-iphone-7-to-the-latest-ios-version-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Upgrade Apple iPhone 7 to the Latest iOS Version? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-11-best-pokemon-go-spoofers-for-gps-spoofing-on-apple-iphone-14-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, 11 Best Pokemon Go Spoofers for GPS Spoofing on Apple iPhone 14 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/movavi-amv-mp4/"><u>Movavi를 사용한 AMV MP4 파일의 무료 온라인 변환 방법 – 비용 부여</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/step-by-step-process-transforming-avchd-videos-in-handbrake-and-discovering-the-best-substitutes/"><u>Step-by-Step Process: Transforming AVCHD Videos in HandBrake and Discovering the Best Substitutes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/unlock-the-secrets-to-enthralling-unboxing-content-on-insta/"><u>Unlock the Secrets to Enthralling Unboxing Content on Insta</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/why-stellar-data-recovery-for-iphone-11-pro-takes-time-in-scanning-my-iphone-stellar-by-stellar-data-recovery-ios-iphone-data-recovery/"><u>Why Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone 11 Pro takes time in scanning my iPhone? | Stellar</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="AI-and-Windows-Activation-The-Unseen-Complications-Stick-to-Manual-Key-Generation-Methods"><a href="#AI-and-Windows-Activation-The-Unseen-Complications-Stick-to-Manual-Key-Generation-Methods" class="headerlink" title="AI and Windows Activation: The Unseen Complications - Stick to Manual Key Generation Methods"></a>AI and Windows Activation: The Unseen Complications - Stick to Manual Key Generation Methods</h2><p> Over the past few days, reports have popped up everywhere about ChatGPT and Bard generating activation keys for Windows 11. Apparently, people are using AI chatbots to create working access keys for the Windows OS, allowing them to use the software for free.Here’s why this probably won’t work and, even if it does, why you shouldn’t use chatbots to generate Windows 11 keys.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qn1XkPJde9Y?si=i6ZJARXO8sJhy2FV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="People-Are-Using-AI-Chatbots-to-Generate-Windows-11-Keys"><a href="#People-Are-Using-AI-Chatbots-to-Generate-Windows-11-Keys" class="headerlink" title="People Are Using AI Chatbots to Generate Windows 11 Keys"></a>People Are Using AI Chatbots to Generate Windows 11 Keys</h2><p> The first reports of people using ChatGPT and Bard to generate activation keys for Windows emerged from Twitter. Initially, users were posting about older versions of the operating system and, over the past few days, generating keys for Windows 10 and 11.</p><p> The reports were quickly picked up by news websites and other publications, but few–if any–seem to have checked whether this method actually works. Instead, they’re simply referring to tweets that claim the generated activation keys generated do, in fact, unlock Windows 11.</p><p> Now, if you go back to many of these tweets posted over the past few days, Twitter itself has added notes, explaining that these codes do not activate the OS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/twitter-contextual-information-chatgpt-windows-activation-codes.jpg"                      alt="Contextual information added by Twitter explaining that Windows 11 keys generated by ChatGPT and Bard will not activate the software"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gyGoQi7hsZk?si=8OcKcPUj2wSBmVZ1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Clearly, this isn’t what’s being reported so widely across the web – so what’s really going on here?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O7ChChlyX2o?si=7pMKdN1NZig1kYek" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Do-AI-Generated-Windows-11-Keys-Actually-Work"><a href="#Do-AI-Generated-Windows-11-Keys-Actually-Work" class="headerlink" title="Do AI-Generated Windows 11 Keys Actually Work?"></a>Do AI-Generated Windows 11 Keys Actually Work?</h2><p> Unfortunately, using software keys generated by tools like ChatGPT is illegal–so we’re not going to put this to the test. Thankfully, through the forgotten art of research, we can quickly figure out why these activation keys aren’t going to work.</p><p> Yes, people are using ChatGPT and Bard to generate activation keys for Windows 11, but this isn’t the same thing as successfully using them to activate the software.</p><p> Unsurprisingly, it turns out ChatGPT and Bard are providing default keys for Windows operating systems. With a default key, you can download, install and even upgrade to specific versions of Windows–but there’s a catch. Default keys cannot activate Windows 11 or any other version of the OS.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wVVp-GggK3U?si=RJb1ClNQV7GjTu_3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Even-AI-Generated-Activation-Keys-Work-They’re-a-Bad-Idea"><a href="#Even-AI-Generated-Activation-Keys-Work-They’re-a-Bad-Idea" class="headerlink" title="Even AI-Generated Activation Keys Work, They’re a Bad Idea"></a>Even AI-Generated Activation Keys Work, They’re a Bad Idea</h2><p> In theory, there is a chance you could generate a working activation key for Windows 11, if you ask ChatGPT or Bard to generate enough of them. Kind of in the same way you might win the lottery if you ask them to predict next week’s numbers enough times.</p><p> However, there’s another problem. Generative AI tools don’t create anything from scratch; they basically copy information that already exists or combine multiple pieces of info into one response.</p><p> So, there’s a good chance ChatGPT is simply copying default keys that are already publicly listed across the internet, or generating look-alikes. If this is the case, you’re not going to get a working activation key, no matter how many times you ask it to generate one.</p><p> Using free or<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/risks-using-cheap-windows-activation-keys/" >cheap Windows activation keys is risky business <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and raises several ethical questions. Above all, even if you manage to generate a working activation key with ChatGPT, it’s illegal to use it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLb1ViO4WR8?si=g_aiHGNCd7eAvmDM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Don’t-Believe-Everything-You-Read-Online"><a href="#Don’t-Believe-Everything-You-Read-Online" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Believe Everything You Read Online"></a>Don’t Believe Everything You Read Online</h2><p> In the age of generative AI, you have to take everything you read with a pinch of salt. These tools have their uses, but the hype and misinformation surrounding AI technology is concerning.</p><p> It’s disappointing to see so many publications cover this story without any research, fact-checking, or due diligence.

The opening keynote, which took place on Monday, focused almost entirely on the buzzword we can’t stop talking about – <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-to-know-about-apples-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >artificial intelligence (AI) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-to-know-about-apples-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >Everything to know about Apple’s AI features coming to iPhones, Macs, and iPads <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>After trailing behind major players like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, Apple unveiled a slew of AI features spread across the company’s most popular operating systems. While AI was the event’s main focus, Apple executives also announced this year’s software upgrades for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, and Vision Pro.</p><p>If you couldn’t tune into the two-hour-long event, ZDNET has you covered. Here’s a complete breakdown of all the announcements from earlier this week.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mK1lEBRm_1w?si=FSaM0OKO0XBCgjtT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Apple-Intelligence-AI"><a href="#Apple-Intelligence-AI" class="headerlink" title="Apple Intelligence (AI)"></a>Apple Intelligence (AI)</h2><p>Maria Diaz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><ul><li>Apple unveiled what it calls its new “personal intelligence” system under the name <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-how-it-works-with-on-device-and-cloud-based-ai/"><strong>Apple Intelligence</strong></a>. The release puts generative models at the heart of the ecosystem of Apple devices.</li><li>With Apple Intelligence, your iPhone can <strong>prioritize notifications</strong> to ensure you get notified only when it’s crucial throughout your day.</li><li>The release includes <strong>writing tools</strong> that leverage AI, including rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text features available across mail, keynotes, third-party apps, and more.</li><li>Users can now create <strong>personalized images</strong> in the photo library, including sketches, illustrations, and animations. This feature is available in Messages, Apps, Freeform, Keynote, and Pages.</li><li>Apple Intelligence can tap into tools and <strong>carry out tasks on your behalf</strong>, such as “Show me all the photos,” “Play the podcast,” or “Pull the files that my coworker shared with me last week.”</li><li>Because it’s grounded in your personal information and context, and can retrieve data from across your apps and reference the content on your screen, Apple Intelligence is positioned to be your <strong>personal assistant</strong>.</li><li>Apple emphasized the <strong>safety and privacy precautions</strong> built into Apple Intelligence, particularly for on-device intelligence processing. The company touted the security of Apple’s silicon, A17 Pro, and its M family of chips (M1, M2, M3, and M4).</li><li>For tasks that are too large for on-device processing and need to be completed in the cloud, Apple unveiled <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-apples-keeping-your-cloud-processed-ai-data-safe-and-why-it-matters/" >Private Cloud Compute <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, which protects users’ privacy by running on servers specially created using Apple Silicon. When users make requests, Apple Intelligence first tests on-device capability, but calls on Private Cloud Compute if the task requires more power. Apple reiterated that user data is never stored or sold to external parties.</li><li><strong>Siri</strong> finally got the AI makeover it deserves, first with a new look: when tapped, light wraps around the edges of your screen. Siri can now <strong>better understand users</strong>, even if they stutter, due to more advanced natural language processing (NLP). It now has <strong>conversational</strong> <strong>context</strong>, remembering what you just said and using it to complete the next task. Users can also <strong>type requests to</strong> <strong>Siri</strong>. Because it has <strong>in-depth product knowledge</strong>, Siri can answer questions about functionality on iPad, iPhone, and Mac. Siri will also have Apple Intelligence’s <strong>on-screen awareness</strong>, allowing it to act on what it sees. The voice assistant can also <strong>take actions</strong> across apps, including photo editing. With access to your <strong>personal context,</strong> Siri can understand and complete new commands, such as pulling your driver’s license information from a photo and inputting it into a form. The Siri updates are coming to iPad and Mac, too.</li><li>Apple Intelligence also powers new features in <strong>Mail</strong>, including <strong>Rewrite</strong>, which offers users different versions of what they have already drafted. <strong>Suggestions</strong> are shown in-line, and <strong>Proofread</strong> edits forgrammar, word choice, and sentence structure. You can also use <strong>Summarize</strong> to convert your text into bullet points. <strong>Smart Reply</strong> identifies relevant selections of an email and uses them to help craft a custom message. Summaries will now appear at the top of emails, making browsing an inbox easier. Apple Intelligence can even help <strong>prioritize</strong> your emails, placing what is most important at the top of your inbox.</li><li>There is an all-new focus option: <strong>reduce interruptions</strong>. When in this setting, your phone will only show you what is most important based on your personal activity and context.</li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-generated-genmoji-solve-a-problem-weve-all-had-before/" >Genmoji <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> allows users to create <strong>AI-generated emojis</strong> based on what they type. You can also create a Genmoji based on a photo of a friend. Genmojis can be included in-line in Messages and even used for Tapbacks.</li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-dall-e-apples-new-ai-image-generator-runs-on-device-and-works-like-magic/" >Image Playground <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> allows users to leverage AI on-device to create images from text prompts, which can be easily shared in iMessage and elsewhere. The feature is also available in Keynote, Pages, and Freeform, and as a stand-alone <strong>Image Playground app.</strong></li><li><strong>Image Wand in the Notes app</strong> transforms a rough sketch into a polished image and is available directly in the tool palette. For example, you can circle a rough sketch in Notes and open Image Playground to transform your doodle into a fully-fledged image.</li><li>Apple Intelligence will also upgrade the Photos app with a new <strong>clean-up tool</strong> that removes unwanted objects. <strong>Search in videos</strong> allows users to easily find specific snippets of content, and users can create <strong>Memories</strong> on-demand, using text to edit and organize photos into movies.</li><li>In the Notes app, users can <strong>record and transcribe audio</strong>, which Apple Intelligence will generate a text summary of. This experience is also available in the Notes phone app.</li><li>Apple Intelligence is free on iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and MacOS Sequoia, and will be available to try in English only this summer.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4q6gyaEojM?si=ImdFm6Zsr0azykqV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Partnership-with-OpenAI"><a href="#Partnership-with-OpenAI" class="headerlink" title="Partnership with OpenAI"></a>Partnership with OpenAI</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><ul><li>Apple also confirmed its partnership with OpenAI by integrating <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-chatgpt-and-why-does-it-matter-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" >ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with Siri. With a user’s permission, Siri can send a request to ChatGPT for help. For example, if you ask Siri for assistance on a task it deems better for ChatGPT, Siri will suggest you use the chatbot instead and forward your request. ChatGPT’s writing capabilities can also be leveraged within certain writing tasks.</li><li>Users can access ChatGPT via this integration for free, and OpenAI will not log their data. ChatGPT Plus users can connect their subscriptions to access more advanced features, in which case OpenAI’s data usage policies apply.</li><li>The ChatGPT integration will be coming to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and MacOS Sequoia later this year.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e4Nt2xXXtmE?si=CtKwFry4b0AJXnaN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="iOS-18"><a href="#iOS-18" class="headerlink" title="iOS 18"></a>iOS 18</h2><p>Adam Breeden&#x2F;ZDNET</p><ul><li>iPhone and iPad users will be able to <strong>customize their home screen</strong> further by placing apps wherever they’d like on the screen, as opposed to the usual fixed grid. <strong>App icon colors</strong> will also be customizable, allowing users to make apps any color they want or even match their home screen.

The Control Center toggle will also feature different pages with completely customizable user controls, and users can <strong>switch controls</strong> on the bottom of the Lock Screen.</li><li>Apple also added privacy options, including the ability to <strong>lock an app</strong>, which requires users to authenticate with Face ID or passcode before accessing the app. Users can also <strong>hide an app</strong>, which makes it disappear from the home screen to a hidden part of their app library.</li><li><strong>Messages</strong> received several upgrades. <strong>Tapbacks</strong>, the feature allowing users to react to messages by holding them down, was upgraded to feature different colors and include emojis. Users can add <strong>text effects</strong> to specific phrases or words instead of the entire phrase.

Its latest, the RedMagic 7 Pro, is one of the most complete devices that we’ve tested to date. </p><p>From the get-go, the phone looks and feels like a true gaming phone, with a bold design and edgy aesthetics. The Supernova variant sports a transparent back that showcases the bevy of gaming-centric features within the device, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, 16GB of RAM, Octa-core CPU, a massive 5,000mAh battery, and the RedMagic’s key selling point: a 20,000 RPM Turbofan. That fan, along with a series of cooling elements within the phone keeps it from overheating and the battery from degrading as fast – both of which are common issues with gaming phones. </p><p>The RedMagic 7 Pro fields a massive 6.8-inch, 120Hz AMOLED display to visualize all the animations and stylistic icons of its Android 12-based software. Turn on any game and Nubia’s Game Space (and the Turbofan) kicks into high gear, providing you with an ample amount of in-game controls, toggles, and plugins. One of which lets you map the shoulder triggers of the phone, giving you an added dimension of inputs no matter what game you play. </p><p><strong>More: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nubia-redmagic-7-pro-review/" >Nubia RedMagic 7 Pro full review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Pros</strong></th><th><strong>Cons</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>16GB of RAM powers through any app or game20,000 RPM Turbofan keeps the phone running efficiently5,000mAh battery with 65W fast charging</td><td>No IP ratingCameras are mediocreNo wireless charging</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RZMLNV6?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C86a268d2-b133-4c1d-b959-0242e3c62460%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Xiaomi-Black-Shark-4-Pro"><a href="#Xiaomi-Black-Shark-4-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Xiaomi Black Shark 4 Pro"></a>Xiaomi Black Shark 4 Pro</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cKRBWf1EDZo?si=CTNd4q450biit4eM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-value"><a href="#Best-value" class="headerlink" title="Best value"></a>Best value</h3><p><strong>Display:</strong> 6.67-inch AMOLED with 144Hz | <strong>Processor:</strong> Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 | <strong>RAM:</strong> 6GB&#x2F;12GB | <strong>Storage:</strong> 128GB&#x2F;256GB | <strong>Weight:</strong> 220g | <strong>Battery:</strong> 4,500mAh | <strong>Operating system:</strong> Android 11</p><p>Black Shark, a sub-brand of Xiaomi, is another contender within the gaming phone market. While costing significantly less than the competition, Black Shark phones tend to carry specs and features that rival that of the very best. </p><p>The latest Black Shark 4 Pro is no different. It starts at just $569 – close to half the cost of the aforementioned picks – but comes equipped with a 6.67-inch, 144Hz AMOLED display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, up to 12GB of RAM, and a 4,500mAh battery that’s capable of 120W fast charging. Basically, the Black Shark is a gaming flagship killer. </p><p>Even then, the highlights of the device are the magnetic, retractable shoulder triggers. Unlike the touch capacitive ones on the Nubia RedMagic 7 Pro, these physical buttons can pop up from the device. That way, the phone stays sleek and uniform when they’re not in use and becomes a full-on gaming device when they are. </p><p><strong>More: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/black-shark-4-pro-review/" >Black Shark 4 Pro full review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Pros</strong></th><th><strong>Cons</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Exceptionally good value for a gaming phone120W fast charging is stupendously quickRetractable shoulder triggers are a gamer’s dream</td><td>No MicroSD card slotSoftware update cadence can be better4,500mAh battery is not the best</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-Phone-5s-2448x1080/dp/B09LXJ7STM?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C86a268d2-b133-4c1d-b959-0242e3c62460%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="ASUS-ROG-Phone-5S"><a href="#ASUS-ROG-Phone-5S" class="headerlink" title="ASUS ROG Phone 5S"></a>ASUS ROG Phone 5S</h2><h3 id="Best-battery-life"><a href="#Best-battery-life" class="headerlink" title="Best battery life"></a>Best battery life</h3><p><strong>Display:</strong> 6.78-inch AMOLED with 144Hz | <strong>Processor:</strong> Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 | <strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB&#x2F;18GB | <strong>Storage:</strong> 256GB&#x2F;512GB | <strong>Weight:</strong> 238g | <strong>Battery:</strong> 6,000mAh | <strong>Operating system:</strong> Android 11</p><p>The ASUS ROG Phone 5S is another comparable gaming flagship, from the sizeable screen to the high-quality audio to the powerful hardware.</p><p>This phone offers a top-notch player experience, thanks to the lightning-fast refresh rate (144Hz), GameFX audio system, and gamer-friendly design. Inside, there’s last year’s Snapdragon 888 processor, which remains a champion for computing power and can operate all types of games. There’s also a huge 6,000mAh battery that’s designed for extended sessions. At that size, the ASUS ROG Phone 5S is our top pick if you seek a gaming phone with high endurance. </p><p>While short of the extra fans and buttons, the ASUS ROG Phone 5S is still a worthy second option to the Nubia RedMagic 7 Pro. There’s a global version of this gaming smartphone available, but it is only compatible with GSM networks like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. Verizon and Sprint customers can look to our other picks for a similar gaming experience. </p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Pros</strong></th><th><strong>Cons</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>6,000mAh battery tops the leaderboard for enduranceSleek curved design is comfortable to hold144Hz refresh rate</td><td>Dull design with some RGB on the backNot compatible with CDMA networksOnly one shoulder trigger</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/galaxy-s/galaxy-s22-ultra-certified-re-newed-128gb-sm5s908uzkaxaa/&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MVZSW5V?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C86a268d2-b133-4c1d-b959-0242e3c62460%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UoBCgLTmznE?si=MXXiGsd2qpd_DrzE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Samsung-Galaxy-S22-Ultra"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-S22-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra"></a>Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</h2><h3 id="Best-mainstream-phone-for-gaming"><a href="#Best-mainstream-phone-for-gaming" class="headerlink" title="Best mainstream phone for gaming"></a>Best mainstream phone for gaming</h3><p><strong>Display:</strong> 6.8-inch AMOLED with 120Hz | <strong>Processor:</strong> Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 | <strong>RAM:</strong> 12GB&#x2F;16GB | <strong>Storage:</strong> 128GB&#x2F;256GB&#x2F;512GB&#x2F;1TB | <strong>Weight:</strong> 228g | <strong>Battery:</strong> 5,000mAh | <strong>Operating system:</strong> Android 12</p><p>While the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra isn’t marketed solely toward gamers, it’s one of the best mainstream phones that can handle graphics-intensive titles. </p><p>On the surface, the Galaxy S22 Ultra fields a spec sheet that competes with traditional gaming phones.

Being a flagship that’s tailored towards the masses, buying the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra means that you’re getting more than just a capable phone for gaming. You’re getting one of the highest-end mobile experiences on the market, with a feature set that will carry you through any task.

While not as RAM and storage heavy as the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, the OnePlus offers a similar gaming experience for $300 less. </p><p>The phone comes with a 6.7-inch, 120Hz AMOLED display, a 5,000mAh battery with 65W fast charging (80W outside of North America), and runs on OxygenOS based on Android 12. Like previous OnePlus devices, the 10 Pro sticks to the brand’s strengths: Ultra smooth performance and speed. From navigating around apps to loading high-demand games, the OnePlus 10 Pro provides a flagship Android experience. It also features the iconic alert slider, so you can toggle off notifications as you game on. </p><p>At $899, the phone isn’t cheap per se, but it undercuts the best that Samsung and Apple have to offer while matching the levels of output. There’s also the new second-generation Hasselblad camera system, which captures excellent photos and videos in various environments. </p><p><strong>More: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/oneplus-10-pro-review/" >OnePlus 10 Pro full review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> </p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Pros</strong></th><th><strong>Cons</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>$899 price tag undercuts mainstream flagshipsSmooth and snappy software experience5,000mAh battery and 65W SuperVOOC charging</td><td>No IP certification (besides US T-Mobile version)Lack of mmWave 5G bandsNo MicroSD card support</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-13-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="iPhone-13-Pro-Max"><a href="#iPhone-13-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="iPhone 13 Pro Max"></a>iPhone 13 Pro Max</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OdlXe5RELW0?si=Iz1H1QnLQVw-Eu3e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-iPhone-for-gaming"><a href="#Best-iPhone-for-gaming" class="headerlink" title="Best iPhone for gaming"></a>Best iPhone for gaming</h3><p><strong>Display:</strong> 6.7-inch AMOLED with 120Hz | <strong>Processor:</strong> A15 Bionic | <strong>RAM:</strong> 6GB | <strong>Storage:</strong> 128GB&#x2F;256GB&#x2F;512GB&#x2F;1TB | <strong>Weight:</strong> 240g | <strong>Battery:</strong> 4,352mAh (est.) | <strong>Operating system:</strong> iOS 15</p><p>As you’ve probably noticed, Android phones make up a majority of the best gaming phones on the market. However, some Apple products hold their own, with the iPhone 13 Pro Max being the best iOS option for gamers. </p><p>Even though the 6GB of RAM seems laughable compared to the double digit specs of other options on this list, the iPhone is notorious for its class-leading efficiency and performance optimizations. To add, there are still plenty of iPhone perks for gamers. Most notably, this phone is built with Apple’s industry-leading A15 Bionic chipset, beating out most flagships in synthetic benchmark tests. And, of course, graphics look incredible on the 6.7-inch OLED display, now with a 120Hz refresh rate to keep things smooth. </p><p>With a starting price of $1,099, you might be wondering: is the iPhone 13 Pro Max worth it for gamers? We think so – as long as you’re okay with giving up a few best-in-class gaming features in exchange for the other fantastic benefits included with Apple phones such as the spectacular front and rear camera features. If the Max is too big, there’s also the regular iPhone 13 Pro, which has proven to be just as capable for mobile gaming. </p><p><strong>More: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-iphone-13-pro-max/" >iPhone 13 Pro Max full review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Pros</strong></th><th><strong>Cons</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Best-in-class iPhone experienceLong-lasting battery lifeIndustry-leading software update policy</td><td>iPhone App Store is not as expansive as Google’sNo sideloading apps or plug-insLightning port is not as universal</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/164505142&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>An innovative engineering marvel Armor Aluminum material for a lighter and sleeker phone High IPX8 water resistant design Extensive S Pen support Software optimized for foldables</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>An innovative engineering marvel Armor Aluminum material for a lighter and sleeker phone High IPX8 water resistant design Extensive S Pen support Software optimized for foldables</li></ul><h2 id="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-3"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-3" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3"></a>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3</h2><h3 id="Best-foldable-for-gaming"><a href="#Best-foldable-for-gaming" class="headerlink" title="Best foldable for gaming"></a>Best foldable for gaming</h3><p><strong>Displays:</strong> 7.6-inch AMOLED with 120Hz (Inner), 6.2-inch AMOLED with 60Hz (Outer) | <strong>Processor:</strong> Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 | <strong>RAM:</strong> 12GB | <strong>Storage:</strong> 256GB&#x2F;512GB | <strong>Weight:</strong> 271g | <strong>Battery:</strong> 4,400mAh | <strong>Operating system:</strong> Android 12 </p><p>By virtue of its design, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is a great pick for gamers.

Not only does it offer 5G connectivity (thanks to the Snapdragon 888 processor), but it also has a gamer-friendly 120Hz refresh rate.

In most cases, ZDNet’s team of subject matter experts have spent up to months testing and reviewing the devices to discern the best from the worst. Our research process also takes into account pricing, technical specifications, customer reviews, and product availability. Each of our picks can be purchased through the manufacturer’s website or from popular retailers like Amazon or Walmart.</p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-gaming-phone"><a href="#What-is-the-best-gaming-phone" class="headerlink" title="What is the best gaming phone?"></a>What is the best gaming phone?</h2><p>We know that different people might be looking for different things when shopping for the best gaming phone. For example, if you want the fastest and most powerful gaming phone on the market, look for products built on innovative processors (like Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and A15) with fast refresh rates and high storage capacity. After evaluating the seven gaming phones above, we concluded that the Nubia RedMagic 7 Pro was the best gaming phone to buy. </p><p>However, if you’re on a budget, then price will probably be your biggest consideration. In that case, we’d recommend an affordable option like the Xiaomi Black Shark 4 Pro or the OnePlus 10 Pro. While they might be slightly less powerful than the best gaming phone, they’ll still offer the essential functionality that you’d need.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>Display size</th><th>Refresh rate</th><th>Processor</th><th>Battery</th><th>Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Nubia RedMagic 7 Pro</td><td>6.8-inch AMOLED</td><td>120Hz</td><td>Snapdragon 8 Gen 1</td><td>5,000mAh</td><td>$899</td></tr><tr><td>Xiaomi Black Shark 4 Pro</td><td>6.67-inch AMOLED</td><td>144Hz</td><td>Snapdragon 888</td><td>4,500mAh</td><td>$569</td></tr><tr><td>ASUS ROG Phone 5S</td><td>6.78-inch AMOLED</td><td>144Hz</td><td>Snapdragon 888</td><td>6,000mAh</td><td>$1,099</td></tr><tr><td>Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</td><td>6.8-inch AMOLED</td><td>120Hz</td><td>Snapdragon 8 Gen 1</td><td>5,000mAh</td><td>$1,199</td></tr><tr><td>OnePlus 10 Pro</td><td>6.7-inch AMOLED</td><td>120Hz</td><td>Snapdragon 8 Gen 1</td><td>5,000mAh</td><td>$899</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 13 Pro Max</td><td>6.7-inch AMOLED</td><td>120Hz</td><td>Apple A15 Bionic</td><td>4,352mAh</td><td>$1,099</td></tr><tr><td>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3</td><td>7.6-inch and 6.2-inch AMOLED</td><td>120Hz, 60Hz</td><td>Snapdragon 888</td><td>4,400mAh</td><td>$1,749</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="What-is-a-gaming-phone"><a href="#What-is-a-gaming-phone" class="headerlink" title="What is a gaming phone?"></a>What is a gaming phone?</h2><p>Technically, any phone that allows you to play games could be considered a gaming phone. However, there are a handful of phones that have been designed and marketed as “gaming phones,” such as the ASUS ROG Phone 5S. For the purposes of our review, we’ve highlighted some of these products, as well as more mainstream options that would work well for gamers (like the iPhone 13 Pro Max).</p><h2 id="Do-you-need-a-dedicated-gaming-phone"><a href="#Do-you-need-a-dedicated-gaming-phone" class="headerlink" title="Do you need a dedicated gaming phone?"></a>Do you need a dedicated gaming phone?</h2><p>Not necessarily. Some popular non-gaming phones are powerful enough to support rigorous mobile gaming. Plus, these phones often outperform dedicated gaming phones when it comes to other features (like camera quality and design). </p><p>Still, if you love mobile gaming and want a product that’s designed for that specific purpose, then a gaming phone might be the right choice.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4-YQ9Wjtfg?si=6afn1fydg_Wb9B8z" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-should-you-look-for-in-a-gaming-phone"><a href="#What-should-you-look-for-in-a-gaming-phone" class="headerlink" title="What should you look for in a gaming phone?"></a>What should you look for in a gaming phone?</h2><p>There are several things to look for when shopping for the best gaming phone. First, you’ll want to look for a phone with a fast, modern processor. The processor is the central technical component of a smartphone, overseeing every command and ensuring your phone performs the tasks you ask of it. Right now, the best processors include the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and Apple A15 Bionic.</p><p>Additionally, you’ll also want to look for a phone with a high screen refresh rate. Measured in Hertz (Hz), this number is an expression of how many times your screen refreshes every second. As you might expect, a higher refresh rate is essential for a smooth gaming experience with less lag. Today’s best gaming phones have refresh rates of at least 120Hz.</p><p>Finally, keep an eye out for phones with ample storage, Random Access Memory (RAM), and battery life. Simply put, the more storage, RAM, and battery capacity your phone has, the better it will be for mobile gaming. You’ll be able to enjoy longer, uninterrupted gaming sessions without slowing down your phone or draining the battery.</p><h2 id="Are-gaming-phones-worth-it"><a href="#Are-gaming-phones-worth-it" class="headerlink" title="Are gaming phones worth it?"></a>Are gaming phones worth it?</h2><p>A gaming phone can absolutely be worth it if you are someone who primarily uses your phone for portable gaming. A dedicated gaming phone is not necessary if you prefer to game on a console or PC and use your phone for more every day activities such as calls, emails, camera capabilities, and more. </p><h2 id="Can-I-use-a-gaming-headset-with-my-phone"><a href="#Can-I-use-a-gaming-headset-with-my-phone" class="headerlink" title="Can I use a gaming headset with my phone?"></a>Can I use a gaming headset with my phone?</h2><p>Most gaming headsets are compatible with phones, if the phone uses a standard 3.5mm audio jack. Many phones today have moved away from the 3.5mm jack, to allow for the phone itself to be thinner and not have to accompany the traditional headphone jack. Several phones on this list, such as the iPhone 13 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S22, use USB-C or lightning cables, however, the easy fix to this problem is to use a dongle that converts from 3.5mm jack to USB-C.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LdVT_-3gESA?si=_HfjpbUEHSRKTXjt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-there-alternatives-worth-considering"><a href="#Are-there-alternatives-worth-considering" class="headerlink" title="Are there alternatives worth considering?"></a>Are there alternatives worth considering?</h2><p>We think that the phones listed above are your best bet for gaming.

Plus, ChatGPT has myriad other uses, from writing professional emails and resumes to generating code or spreadsheet formulas. These amazing browser extensions augment ChatGPT’s abilities to make the AI responses and prompts better than ever.</p><p> While some of the extensions improve the ChatGPT app, others use the AI’s abilities in other webapps (such as Gmail) to improve the experience there. Do note that all but of one of these extensions require you to have a registered free account on OpenAI’s ChatGPT portal.</p><h2 id="1-WebChatGPT"><a href="#1-WebChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="1.

If you know<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/" >how ChatGPT works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll know that it isn’t scraping the internet for the latest information about any topic or news. The AI works on older data and doesn’t search the internet. WebChatGPT is an innovative workaround for this problem that adds web search results to ChatGPT.</p><p> Here’s how it works. Once you install the extension and open ChatGPT, you’ll see a bar under the usual dialog box for queries and prompts. Toggle the<strong>Search the Web</strong> button to activate WebChatGPT and select parameters. You can ask it to search for up to 10 results, set how far back it’ll search for links (day, week, month, year), and set a region.</p><p> When you give ChatGPT any prompt, it’ll conduct a web search and gather the results. Then, the extension automatically frames a revised prompt that includes those latest results and your original query, instructing ChatGPT to scan and include the results.</p><p> The final output from the AI thus gives you more up-to-date information, such as news summaries, sports statistics, weather reports and forecasts, and stock market updates.</p><p> You can customize the default revised prompt that WebChatGPT uses, but as a new user, we wouldn’t suggest that.

The extension lets you save entire chats with the ChatGPT AI as a PDF, PNG, or Markdown HTML file directly from the browser. You can also use custom themes for the chat interface, but that’s more about looks than function.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> ChatGPT Prompt Genius for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-history/jjdnakkfjnnbbckhifcfchagnpofjffo/" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatgpt-history/" >Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="3-ChatGPT-Writer"><a href="#3-ChatGPT-Writer" class="headerlink" title="3.

When you fire up ChatGPT Writer, you’ll see the original email and find a box to enter what you want to reply briefly.</p><p> You can make it a simple and easy command; for example, “Write a reply to this email about my interest in the job and seek information about salary.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chatgpt-writer-1.jpg"                      alt="an email reply using chatgpt writer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o-sRtqHdEYY?si=NMTMQVxJsUaoguqh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> ChatGPT Writer will take a few seconds and then compose a long, professional message along those lines. You can change or edit any words within the box, or redo your prompt if it’s not satisfactory. When you’re happy with the result, insert it directly into the<strong>Reply</strong> box, and you’re ready to send it.</p><p> The first time you use ChatpGPT Writer, you’ll need to log in to your OpenAI account with it. The extension works with any Chromium browser such as Chrome, Brave, or Edge. While it’s currently best for replying to professional emails, you can also give it non-work prompts to write casual and personal email messages.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> ChatGPT Writer for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-writer-write-mail/pdnenlnelpdomajfejgapbdpmjkfpjkp/" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZma8PBO0D8?si=9-qQgGVTuChYd27a" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-YouTube-Summary-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#4-YouTube-Summary-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="4.

Many times, all you want is a transcript to quickly browse through what the video is going to say so that you can know if it’s worth your time.</p><p> Install YouTube Summary With ChatGPT and go to any video. The right sidebar now has a box for<strong>Transcript &amp; Summary</strong> , clicking which will open a time-stamped transcript of the video generated by ChatGPT.</p><p> Click any timestamp to be taken to that moment in the video. If you’re already midway through the video, you can jump to the current time in the transcript.

But Google Chrome offers some excellent voice commands and text-to-speech features. Talk-to-ChatGPT bridges this gap to let you issue prompts by talking to your computer and having the ChatGPT answers read aloud by AI.</p><p> Once you install the extension, refresh the ChatGPT tab once, and press<strong>Start</strong> in the extension to allow access. A floating panel in the top-right of your screen shows whether it’s active or not, and you can toggle it to record, playback audio to read the answers or pause.</p><p> Talk-to-ChatGPT is an open-source extension that lets you fiddle around with the settings. You can choose from different AI voices, the voice pitch, and the speed at which text is read. It also supports voice command shortcuts of “Stop” and “Pause” to control playback.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Talk-to-ChatGPT for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/talk-to-chatgpt/hodadfhfagpiemkeoliaelelfbboamlk" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="6-ChatGPT-for-Search-Engines"><a href="#6-ChatGPT-for-Search-Engines" class="headerlink" title="6.

But, like anything in tech, it carries an ugly side to it, too. The rise of fake news and misinformation, for instance, is one of its biggest unwanted by-products.</p><p> Perplexity AI can help you cut the misinformation out. Indeed, as the developers put it, the tool works as a combination of Google and ChatGPT. Simply type in your query in the extension and the tool will summarize you the best possible result—along with the legitimate cited sources. The last part here is very important.</p><p> While the tool summarizes the information in a neat manner, it ends the answers with a quick mention of the best, legitimate sources. And while there’s still a possibility of fault here (you’d still need to rely on the sources that Perplexity provides), we believe it’s much better than going in blind with the usual, source-less responses you’d otherwise gotten from ChatGPT.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Perplexity AI for<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perplexity-ai-companion/hlgbcneanomplepojfcnclggenpcoldo" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-Is-Awesome-But-Be-Realistic…"><a href="#ChatGPT-Is-Awesome-But-Be-Realistic…" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Is Awesome, But Be Realistic…"></a>ChatGPT Is Awesome, But Be Realistic…</h2><p> With these extensions including search results in ChatGPT, showing you how to use the right prompts, and using AI to improve YouTube or Gmail, you might think it’s time to offload a majority of your work to ChatGPT. But take a breath.</p><p> Yes, the AI capabilities are amazing compared to what has existed before this, but ChatGPT isn’t ready for prime-time yet. It still has a long way to go and depends largely upon the user keying in the right prompts. The data that it bases its answers on can also leave a lot to be desired in certain cases. For now, feel free to use it, but don’t rely wholly on it, and take those results with a pinch of salt.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-leading-edge-tech-for-action-footage-capture/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Leading Edge Tech for Action Footage Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-definitive-list-of-premium-vector-sites/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Definitive List of Premium Vector Sites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-exploring-melodies-your-path-to-pixel-tunes-customization/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Exploring Melodies Your Path to Pixel Tunes Customization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-depth-steps-using-mobizen-for-smooth-screen-recording-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] In-Depth Steps Using Mobizen for Smooth Screen Recording for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/apple-discontinues-premium-finewoven-series-embraces-new-era-with-beats-protective-cases-tech-news-by-zdnet/"><u>Apple Discontinues Premium FineWoven Series: Embraces New Era with Beats Protective Cases | Tech News by ZDNet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/easily-track-your-apple-tv-remote-using-our-new-airtag-attachment-find-out-how/"><u>Easily Track Your Apple TV Remote Using Our New AirTag Attachment - Find Out How !</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/experts-weigh-in-on-iphone-15-essential-upgrades-that-even-seasoned-professionals-will-love-insight/"><u>Experts Weigh in on iPhone 15: Essential Upgrades That Even Seasoned Professionals Will Love Insight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-the-benefits-of-orbis-whole-house-internet-solution-with-wi-fi-6-capabilities/"><u>Exploring the Benefits of Orbi's Whole House Internet Solution with Wi-Fi 6 Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/get-your-hands-on-the-latest-apple-watch-series-10-exclusive-pre-order-guide-and-top-tips-for-savings-discover-more/"><u>Get Your Hands on the Latest Apple Watch Series 10: Exclusive Pre-Order Guide & Top Tips for Savings – Discover More!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-apple-integrates-advanced-image-recognition-in-iphone-16-mirroring-google-lens-exclusive-report-by-zdnet/"><u>How Apple Integrates Advanced Image Recognition in iPhone 16, Mirroring Google Lens - Exclusive Report by ZDNet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfecting-online-visuals-beauty-focused-color-correction/"><u>In 2024, Perfecting Online Visuals Beauty-Focused Color Correction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/iphone-call-recording-guide-understanding-legality-by-state-tips-and-techniques/"><u>IPhone Call Recording Guide: Understanding Legality by State - Tips & Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/possible-solutions-to-restore-deleted-messages-from-realme-c51-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/"><u>Possible solutions to restore deleted messages from Realme C51</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/recovering-vanished-pics-with-ios-175-explained-by-apple-next-steps-for-users/"><u>Recovering Vanished Pics with iOS 17.5 Explained by Apple - Next Steps for Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/solved-move-from-vivo-t2-5g-to-ios-not-working-problems-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>Solved Move from Vivo T2 5G to iOS not Working Problems | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/the-best-8-vpn-hardware-devices-reviewed-on-samsung-galaxy-f04-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>The Best 8 VPN Hardware Devices Reviewed On Samsung Galaxy F04 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-leading-mp3-players-for-202n4-featured-on-zdnet/"><u>Ultimate Guide to the Leading MP3 Players for 202N4 - Featured on ZDNet</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

So, what happens when a trusted software provider delivers an update that causes those PCs to immediately stop working?</p><p>As of July 19, 2024, we know the answer to that question: Chaos ensues.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/7-password-rules-to-live-by-in-2024-according-to-security-experts/" >7 password rules to live by in 2024, according to security experts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In this case, the trusted software developer is a firm called CrowdStrike Holdings, whose previous claim to fame was being the security firm that analyzed the 2016 hack of servers owned by the Democratic National Committee. That’s just a quaint memory now, as the firm will forever be known as The Company That Caused <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/crowdstrike-causes-windows-outage-chaos-for-airports-banks-and-more-heres-what-happened/" >The Largest IT Outage In History <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

That’s a tiny percentage of the worldwide installed base, but as David Weston, Microsoft’s Vice President for Enterprise and OS Security, notes, “the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services.” According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/crowdstrike-update-that-caused-global-outage-likely-skipped-checks-experts-say-2024-07-20/" >a Reuters report <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, “Over half of Fortune 500 companies and many government bodies such as the top US cybersecurity agency itself, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, use the company’s software.”</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XA_wP7rS9ww?si=LarMG3sEHAhSoL6q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-happened"><a href="#What-happened" class="headerlink" title="What happened?"></a>What happened?</h2><p>CrowdStrike, which sells security software designed to keep systems safe from external attacks, pushed a faulty <a class="link"   href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/falcon-update-for-windows-hosts-technical-details/" >“sensor configuration update” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the millions of PCs worldwide running its Falcon Sensor software. That update was, according to CrowdStrike, a “Channel File” whose function was to identify newly observed, malicious activity by cyberattackers.</p><p>Although the update file had a .sys extension, it was not itself a kernel driver. It communicates with other components in the Falcon sensor that run in the same space as the Windows kernel, the most privileged level on a Windows PC, where they interact directly with memory and hardware. CrowdStrike says a “logic error” in that code caused Windows PCs and servers to crash within seconds after they booted up, displaying a STOP error, more colloquially known as the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-changing-how-it-delivers-windows-updates-4-things-you-need-to-know/" >Microsoft is changing how it delivers Windows updates: 4 things you need to know <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In a <a class="link"   href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/" >Preliminary Post Incident Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> posted on its website July 24, CrowdStrike confirmed some details about the incident that had previously been reported and added a few more. The code that failed was part of the Falcon sensor, which runs in the Windows kernel space. Version 7.11 of the sensor was released on February 28, 2024. According to CrowdStrike, this release introduced “a new [InterProcess Communication (IPC)] Template Type to detect novel attack techniques that abuse Named Pipes. This release followed all Sensor Content testing procedures…”</p><p>Three additional instances of the IPC Template Type were deployed between April 8 and April 24, without incident. On July 19, the company says, “two additional IPC Template Instances were deployed. Due to a bug in the Content Validator, one of the two Template Instances passed validation despite containing problematic content data.” Those instances were deployed into production. “When received by the sensor and loaded into the Content Interpreter,” the report continues, “problematic content in Channel File 291 resulted in an out-of-bounds memory read triggering an exception. This unexpected exception could not be gracefully handled, resulting in a Windows operating system crash (BSOD).”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/who-needs-ransomware-when-a-faulty-software-update-can-shut-down-critical-infrastructure/" >Who needs ransomware when a faulty software update can shut down critical infrastructure? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Repairing the damage from a flaw like this is a painfully tedious process that requires manually rebooting every affected PC into the Windows Recovery Environment and then deleting the defective file from the PC using the old-school command line interface. If the PC in question has its system drive protected by Microsoft’s BitLocker encryption software, as virtually all business PCs do, the fix requires one extra step: entering a unique 48-character BitLocker recovery key to gain access to the drive and allow the removal of the faulty CrowdStrike driver.</p><p>If you know anyone whose job involves administering Windows PCs in a corporate network that uses the CrowdStrike code, you can be confident they are very busy right now, and will be for days to come.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/793ViIxl4tI?si=DDBkjPlPX5bZ-f1Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="We’ve-seen-this-movie-before"><a href="#We’ve-seen-this-movie-before" class="headerlink" title="We’ve seen this movie before"></a>We’ve seen this movie before</h2><p>When I first heard about this catastrophe (and I am not misusing that word, I assure you), I thought it sounded familiar.

And by “slight problem,” I mean the kind that renders a PC useless until tech support shows up to repair the damage manually. As I commented on Twitter earlier today, I’m not sure any virus writer has ever developed a piece of malware that shut down as many machines as quickly as McAfee did today.</p></blockquote><p>In that case, McAfee had delivered a faulty virus definition (DAT) file to PCs running Windows XP. That file falsely detected a crucial Windows system file, Svchost.exe, as a virus and deleted it. The result, according to <a class="link"   href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/McAfee+DAT+5958+Update+Issues/8656" >a contemporary report <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, is that “affected systems will enter a reboot loop and [lose] all network access.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/" >The best VPN services: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The parallels between that 2010 incident and this year’s CrowdStrike outage are uncanny. At its core was a defective update, pushed to millions of PCs running a powerful software agent, causing the affected devices to stop working. Recovery required manual intervention on every single device. Plus, the flawed code was pushed out by a public security company desperately trying to grow in a brutally competitive marketplace.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The timing was particularly unfortunate for McAfee.

It knocked 10% of the cash registers at Australia’s largest grocery chain offline, forcing the closure of 14 to 18 stores.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-ways-to-save-your-windows-10-pc-in-2025-and-most-are-free/" >5 ways to save your Windows 10 PC in 2025 - and most are free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In the You Can’t Make This Up Department… CrowdStrike’s founder and CEO, George Kurtz, was McAfee’s Chief Technology Officer during that 2010 incident.</p><p>What makes the 2024 sequel so much worse is that it also affected Windows-based servers running in the cloud, on Microsoft Azure and on AWS.

It seems self-evident that a similar failure in QA is at work here. Were these two CrowdStrike updates not tested before they were pushed out to millions of devices?</p><p>Part of the problem might be a company culture that’s long on tough talk. In the most recent CrowdStrike earnings call, CEO George Kurtz boasted about the company’s ability to “ship game-changing products at a rapid pace,” taking special aim at Microsoft:</p><blockquote><p>And more recently, following yet another major Microsoft breach in CIS’ Cyber Safety Review Board’s findings, we received an outpouring of requests from the market for help. We decided enough is enough, there’s a widespread crisis of confidence among security and IT teams within the Microsoft security customer base.</p><p>[…]</p><p>Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. CISAs now have the ability to reduce monoculture risk from only using Microsoft products and cloud services. Our innovation continues at breakneck pace multiplying the reasons for the market to consolidate on Falcon. Thousands of organizations are consolidating on the Falcon platform.</p></blockquote><p>Given recent events, some of those customers might be wondering whether that “breakneck pace” is part of the problem.</p><p>As part of its initial response, CrowdStrike says it plans to take additional measures to improve “software resiliency and testing.” More importantly, it plans to implement a “staggered deployment strategy … in which updates are gradually deployed to larger portions of the sensor base, starting with a canary deployment.” The company also committed to provide customers with “greater control over the delivery of Rapid Response Content updates by allowing granular selection of when and where these updates are deployed.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the United States House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee plans to call CrowdStrike’s CEO up for hearings on what went wrong, and CrowdStrike’s Chief Security Officer, Shawn Henry, <a class="link"   href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7220983915421806592/" >posted an apology on LinkedIn <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, admitting “On Friday, we failed you. … The confidence we built in drips over the years was lost in buckets within hours, and it was a gut punch.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HMuxjTCMX2E?si=ylRTMJuUstpjLsZc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-much-fault-should-Microsoft-shoulder"><a href="#How-much-fault-should-Microsoft-shoulder" class="headerlink" title="How much fault should Microsoft shoulder?"></a>How much fault should Microsoft shoulder?</h2><p>It’s impossible to let Microsoft completely off the hook. After all, the Falcon sensor problems were unique to Windows PCs, as admins of Linux and Mac-focused shops were quick to remind us.</p><p>Partly, that’s an architectural issue. Developers of system-level apps for Windows, including security software, historically implement their features using kernel extensions and drivers. As this example illustrates, faulty code running in the kernel space can cause unrecoverable crashes, whereas code running in user space can’t.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/seven-ways-to-make-windows-11-less-annoying/" >7 ways to make Windows 11 less annoying <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That used to be the case with MacOS as well, but in 2020, with MacOS 11, Apple changed the architecture of its flagship OS to <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/securely-extending-the-kernel-sec8e454101b/web" >strongly discourage the use of kernel extensions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Instead, developers are urged to write system extensions that run in user space rather than at the kernel level. On MacOS, CrowdStrike <a class="link"   href="https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-bolsters-endpoint-protection-platform-new" >uses Apple’s Endpoint Security Framework <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and says using that design, “Falcon achieves the same levels of visibility, detection, and protection exclusively via a user space sensor.”</p><p>Could Microsoft make the same sort of change for Windows? Perhaps, but doing so would certainly bring down the wrath of antitrust regulators, especially in Europe. The problem is especially acute because Microsoft has a lucrative enterprise security business, and any architectural change that makes life more difficult for competitors like CrowdStrike would be rightly seen as anticompetitive.</p><p>Indeed, a Microsoft spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that it can’t follow Apple’s lead because of antitrust concerns. <a class="link"   href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/microsoft-tech-outage-role-crowdstrike-50917b90?st=n4q3srxshb10vz3&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" >According to the WSJ report <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, “In 2009, Microsoft agreed it would give makers of security software the same level of access to Windows that Microsoft gets.” That concern might be open for debate, but given Microsoft’s history with EU regulators, it’s understandable why the company hasn’t wanted to get tangled up in that argument. </p><p>Microsoft currently <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/api/apis-intro" >offers APIs for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but competitors aren’t likely to use them. They’d much rather argue that their software is superior, and using the “inferior” offering from Microsoft would be hard to explain to customers.</p><p>Nonetheless, this incident, which caused many billions of dollars’ worth of damage, should be a wake-up call for the entire IT community. At a minimum, CrowdStrike needs to step up its testing game, and customers need to be more cautious about allowing this sort of code to deploy on their networks without testing it themselves.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/"  title="20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really">20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/"  title="Want a programming job?

Upgrading from the now discontinued Google Pixel 5, the Pixel 6 Pro incorporates three new camera lenses and allows for up to 4X optical zoom. Housing the improved sensors is a unique visor look that now defines the Pixel phone lineup. </p><p>One standout camera feature on the Pixel 6 Pro is <strong>Motion Mode,</strong> whichallows users to capture a clear photo of a moving object, something you’d typically need a tripod for. Motion Mode includes an Action Pan option to dial up the shutter speed and capture fast-moving subjects like cars and subways. There’s also a Long Exposure option that, like Action Pan, adds a creative blur to the background for a “Pro” look and feel. </p><p>Another new and useful feature is <strong>Magic Eraser.</strong> Like Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill, the software trick allows you to magically erase unwanted objects from a photo. Using the feature is as simple as circling what you’d like to erase from your image, whether that’s strangers in the background, stain marks, or signage, and the Pixel 6 Pro does the rest. When done correctly, the image will look like it was perfectly captured in the first place. </p><h3 id="2-You-want-a-bigger-battery"><a href="#2-You-want-a-bigger-battery" class="headerlink" title="2. You want a bigger battery"></a>2. You want a bigger battery</h3><p>While Apple’s iPhones have made significant improvements to battery life since the early days, the Google Pixel 6 Pro wins the endurance battle. With 5,003 mAh (versus the iPhone’s suggested 3,095 mAh), the Pixel 6 Pro can withstand a day’s use with more ease than Apple’s Pro phone. Google says the Pixel 6 Pro can support up to 9 hours of YouTube playback with just a single charge, which is close to our in-house experiences. It also helps that the Pixel supports USB-C fast charging, a more standardized method of charging than Apple’s proprietary Lightning port. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-6-pro-review/" >One year later, Google Pixel 6 Pro is still Google’s best smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>CNET</p><h3 id="3-You-want-a-sleek-innovative-design"><a href="#3-You-want-a-sleek-innovative-design" class="headerlink" title="3. You want a sleek, innovative design"></a>3. You want a sleek, innovative design</h3><p>While the iPhone 13 Pro stuck to its traditional, stainless-steel design, only adding a larger camera bump, Google’s design broke creative boundaries, especially when compared to previous Pixel generations. Featuring a camera bar that stretches across the back, the Pixel camera doesn’t take up half of your phone like that of the iPhone 13 Pro. The bar slightly protrudes from the back glass – about 3mm from the surface – which keeps the whole device wobble-free when laid flat. </p><p>With a Gorilla Glass Victus rear and a curved aluminum-edged frame, the Pixel 6 Pro is sleek and durably built. There’s also no notch to distract you from viewing content and, instead of FaceID, the Pixel has an in-screen fingerprint scanner that has proven to function accurately. </p><p>Lastly, the Pixel 6 Pro runs on the latest Android 12 software, with Android 13 on the horizon. With improved theme capabilities, new adaptive widgets, and a slew of Android perks, the Pixel software is both pleasing to the eye and practical. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HYR2NC8/ref=asc_df_B09HYR2NC81727089200000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B09HYR2NC8&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cb2ed0d28-7c61-4230-bccc-e2b6786a54f7%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Buy the Google Pixel 6 Pro $399.99 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJJbj1vbzs8?si=X3zd8thLJKprfuEa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-iPhone-13-Pro-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-iPhone-13-Pro-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the iPhone 13 Pro if…"></a>You should buy the iPhone 13 Pro if…</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nl0Z0eth1u4?si=0eecOBNfc--51AJO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-You-want-cinematic-camera-features"><a href="#1-You-want-cinematic-camera-features" class="headerlink" title="1. You want cinematic camera features"></a>1. You want cinematic camera features</h3><p>Every year, the new “Pro” iPhone comes with a suite of camera features to justify the branding. The 13 Pro introduces a new Macro Mode for close-up shots, photographic styles for quick color overlays, and Cinematic Mode video recording. </p><p>By using the ultra-wide lens, Macro Mode lets you capture close-up shots of subjects – as close as just 2 centimeters away – while keeping things sharp and in focus. It’s a nifty camera trick that offers a different perspective than the standard wide angle. </p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-13-pro-how-to-disable-this-super-annoying-camera-feature/"><strong>How to disable this super annoying camera feature on the iPhone 13 Pro</strong></a></p><p>The iPhone 13 Pro also features new photographic styles. Different from your typical Instagram filters, these styles change how the iPhone captures photos by placing a cooler, warmer, or even black and white, digital film over the shots. This feature can save you from editing a photo after the fact.</p><p>Lastly, Cinematic Mode shoots videos with a soft, out-of-focus background so that the subject of interest and the depth map are kept separate. With AI processing, the focus can intelligently shift when the subject turns around and his or her back is then facing the camera. Overall, the special mode gives a more movie-like quality to your iPhone videos </p><h3 id="2-You-own-other-Apple-products-AirPods-Apple-Watch-iPad-MacBook-etc"><a href="#2-You-own-other-Apple-products-AirPods-Apple-Watch-iPad-MacBook-etc" class="headerlink" title="2. You own other Apple products (AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, MacBook, etc.)"></a>2. You own other Apple products (AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, MacBook, etc.)</h3><p>There’s a reason for Apple’s cult following and customer loyalty. Its products have always followed a “strength in numbers” philosophy, enhancing existing services when more than one device is integrated. This interlocking of hardware and software is best described as Apple’s walled garden, making it difficult for users to switch out once they’re invested. </p><p>While not an actual product, the Apple ecosystem is still very much part of the product you purchase when investing in, say, an iPhone. Your Apple ID credentials serve as the ecosystem’s life source, allowing you to manage and protect multiple devices effortlessly. If you already own a pair of AirPods, an Apple Watch, or a MacBook, then buying the iPhone 13 Pro will make more sense usability-wise. </p><p>Image: Apple</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTb4xHzeQEk?si=9Sqq-gFWnHc8x3_P" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-You-want-the-best-software-and-hardware-support"><a href="#3-You-want-the-best-software-and-hardware-support" class="headerlink" title="3. You want the best software and hardware support"></a>3. You want the best software and hardware support</h3><p>Along with the ecosystem, the purchase of an Apple device also comes with an extensive software update policy and an abundance of physical storefronts for customer service. Apple is known for providing timely (and somewhat <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-15-destroyed-your-iphones-battery-life-dont-panic/" >controversial) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> iOS updates for as long as seven years after an iPhone is released. Occurring every few months, Apple’s regular updates keep your device secure from bugs, security concerns, and other software flaws, while OS updates bring the latest features to your iPhone. </p><p>This support extends to the many physical Apple storefronts, equipped with customer service resources and inventory. With over 272 storefronts in the United States, alone, Apple has a variety of stores you can visit for quality assistance and maintenance. That said, if you prefer in-person troubleshooting, an iPhone may be the better pocket Pro for you. </p><p><a class="link"

The Apple Watch SE, for example, is perfect for someone who doesn’t want to spend a lot on a smartwatch, or for a parent who wants to be able to get in touch with a child using <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211768" >Apple’s Family Setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. </p><p><strong>Review: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-8-review/" >Apple Watch Series 8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>And then there’s the Apple Watch Series 8 and the Apple Watch Ultra. The watches have two completely different designs but have a lot of features that overlap, such as the new temperature sensor, women’s health features and crash detection, along with the staple ECG, fall detection and blood oxygen features. So which one should you get? Well, the decision may be easier than you think.

You’re ready for a new Apple Watch design"></a>1. You’re ready for a new Apple Watch design</h3><p>The Apple Watch Ultra has mostly the same design language as a traditional Apple Watch, but with a modern flair. Instead of the display sitting on the top of the housing, it’s now recessed in the titanium body to help protect it. On the right side of the housing is the familiar Digital Crown and side button that’s been on every Apple Watch model, but they, too, are protected by the titanium housing. </p><p>On the left side of the watch is a new Action button that’s easy to spot because of its bright orange color. The Action button is customizable, making it possible to assign tasks of your choosing such as begin a workout, launch a Shortcut or mark a waypoint during a hike. This extra button is not available on the Apple Watch Series 8. </p><p>The 49mm housing is also the biggest Apple Watch made to date, and with double the brightness of the Series 8, the screen is sure to be easy to see in all conditions – including direct sunlight. </p><p>With a new design comes new bands, as well. There are <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-apple-watch-ultra-bands-work-with-other-apple-watch-models-too/" >three completely new watchband designs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, each one designed for different activities such as outdoor adventures, endurance training and water sports. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxv4NM-89CU?si=Uj5rOkhrwZ_6QIuW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-You-ride-hike-or-dive…-a-lot"><a href="#2-You-ride-hike-or-dive…-a-lot" class="headerlink" title="2. You ride, hike or dive… a lot"></a>2. You ride, hike or dive… a lot</h3><p>Speaking of outdoor activities, the Ultra is specifically made for extreme fitness enthusiasts who need longer battery life, a better, brighter display and improved GPS tracking. </p><p>Apple touts 36 hours of battery life for the Ultra during normal use, or 60 hours when you activate low power mode. The Ultra is compatible with two different GPS frequencies, L1 and L5, which should provide <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-l5-precision-dual-frequency-gps-why-is-apple-using-it-and-do-you-need-it" >accurate and precise location information <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> regardless of your surroundings. The new compass app will track your route during a hike or bike ride, and then provide waypoints for you to find your way back – should you get lost. </p><p>Every Apple Watch Ultra comes with LTE capabilities, so as long as you pay your wireless carrier for an additional plan (usually around $10 a month), your watch will always be connected, even if you leave your iPhone behind. </p><h3 id="3-You-need-a-ruggedized-watch"><a href="#3-You-need-a-ruggedized-watch" class="headerlink" title="3. You need a ruggedized watch"></a>3. You need a ruggedized watch</h3><p>As for ruggedness, the Ultra has a long list of certifications – most of which I had no idea existed until now. For instance, the Ultra is EN13319 certified, which is a widely recognized standard for dive computers and depth gauges. There’s a depth sensor built into the watch itself so it’ll know when you’re diving and automatically adjust to the environment. Its water resistance is rated at 100 meters, which goes toe to toe with <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-sports-watch/" >actual sport watches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>The Ultra is also MIL-STD 810H certified for harsh conditions and temperatures, with Apple claiming it’ll work in temperatures ranging from -20 degrees Celsius to 55 degrees Celsius. </p><p>There’s even an 86-decibel siren built into the watch should you need emergency help. Apple claims the siren can be heard up to 600 feet away. </p><p><strong>More: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-price-release-date-features-colors-everything-you-need-to-know/" >Apple Watch Ultra: Price, release date, and features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-ultra&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Apple Watch Ultra $799 at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-Apple-Watch-Series-8-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-Apple-Watch-Series-8-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the Apple Watch Series 8 if…"></a>You should buy the Apple Watch Series 8 if…</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><h3 id="1-You-want-a-traditional-Apple-Watch-design"><a href="#1-You-want-a-traditional-Apple-Watch-design" class="headerlink" title="1. You want a traditional Apple Watch design"></a>1. You want a traditional Apple Watch design</h3><p>If the Apple Watch Ultra’s design isn’t all that appealing to you, the Apple Watch Series 8 may be the better choice. It uses the same design as the last few Apple Watch models and comes in 41mm and 45mm sizes. On the right side of the aluminum (or steel) housing is the digital crown and side button that’s used for navigating the watch. </p><p>If you have an older Apple Watch, your watch bands will work on the Series 8 without any issues (assuming you get the same sized watch). And, if you happen to like the new Ultra watch bands and have a 44mm or 45mm Apple Watch, you can buy and use one of the new Ultra bands on the Series 8. </p><p>The Series 8 is available in four aluminum colors this year. There’s Starlight, Midnight, Silver and Product Red. The stainless steel models come in Gold, Graphite and Space Black. </p><p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-apple-watch-ultra-bands-work-with-other-apple-watch-models-too/"><strong>New Apple Watch Ultra bands work with other Apple Watch models, too</strong></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UoBCgLTmznE?si=MXXiGsd2qpd_DrzE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-You’re-not-ready-to-pay-799-for-a-watch"><a href="#2-You’re-not-ready-to-pay-799-for-a-watch" class="headerlink" title="2.

Both of those prices are for an aluminum body and lack cellular connectivity. If you want to add cellular capabilities, you’ll pay a $100 premium – bringing the total to $499 and $529, respectively. </p><p>Still, those prices are more affordable than the Ultra’s price tag and the Series 8 is sure to last a few years, or at least until Apple stops providing software updates to it. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXIq2G0nShk?si=5Z4Fwv7ZB6oKWsdd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Don’t-need-all-of-the-extreme-outdoor-features"><a href="#3-Don’t-need-all-of-the-extreme-outdoor-features" class="headerlink" title="3.

Don’t need all of the extreme outdoor features</h3><p>Even if you like the design of the Ultra, it has more features than I’d wager most people will ever need. Two different types of GPS tracking, the ability to withstand a depth of 100m underwater, and the 2,000 nits display for outdoor viewing can all be overkill. </p><p>With the Series 8, you’re still getting a watch that’s more than capable of tracking your regular exercise and workouts, your sleep, and now, with the added temperature sensor, you can even view your body’s temperature while you sleep. And for women, this plays into <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-8-body-temperature-sensor-ovulation-cycles-tracking/" >reproductive health <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>The Series 8 is water resistant, as well, and can be used while swimming or even surfing in the ocean.

Fortunately, AI tools are now able to help. These tools all use AI to help generate entire presentations from scratch using nothing but the text that you give them.</p><p> If you’ve ever wanted to generate your presentations more efficiently, then these tools can help you do that. Here are some great tools that use AI to make presentations for you.</p><p> Your browser does not support the video tag.</p><h2 id="1-Decktopus-AI"><a href="#1-Decktopus-AI" class="headerlink" title="1.Decktopus AI"></a>1.<a class="link"   href="https://www.decktopus.com/" >Decktopus AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/decktopus-ai-presentation-generator-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="A Screenshot of Decktopus AI s Generative Presentation Tool"                ></p><p> Decktopus is an AI-powered presentation generator that aims to simplify the process of making presentations for any situation, and getting started with it couldn’t be easier. All you have to do is type out a description of what you want your presentation to be about. If you’re not sure, Decktopus can often provide some useful suggestions.</p><p> From there, Decktopus will help ask you several questions to generate a presentation tailored to your needs. Who the presentation is aimed at, what the aim of the presentation is, how long you want to be presenting for, and what template to use for the presentation are all questions you may receive.</p><p> Each of these questions comes with several pre-generated responses, but you can always input your own by typing out what it is that you want. Then, Decktopus will then have your presentation entirely generated based on your inputs. The results look good on their own, but you can also adjust the themes and colors.</p><p> On top of this, Decktopus also generates multiple layouts for its slides, so you can adjust it that way. If you really don’t like what Decktopus has created, you can also regenerate the presentation in its entirety to get a new AI response.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xtylXDY9YfA?si=VonzSiDFGCpJm2uC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-SlidesAI-io"><a href="#2-SlidesAI-io" class="headerlink" title="2.SlidesAI.io"></a>2.<a class="link"   href="https://www.slidesai.io/" >SlidesAI.io <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/slides-ai-presentation-generator-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="A Screenshot of the SlidesAI io Google Slides Add-on"                ></p><p> If you’re looking for an AI presentation generator that works directly within Google Slides, then you can’t go wrong with SlidesAI.io. That’s because SlidesAI.io is a Google Workspace add-on.</p><p> There are already Workspace add-ons that let you<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-use-chatgpt-google-sheets/" >use ChatGPT on Google Sheets and Google Docs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and SlidesAI.io aims to do the same by letting you use AI to generate entire presentations in Google Slides.</p><p> With SlidesAI.io, all you have to do is enter some text for the add-on to work with. There’s a character limit here for free users, though you can upgrade for a higher limit. The more words you use, the more consistent the results will be.</p><p> Alternatively, you can ask SlidesAI.io to create a presentation using just a simple title. The process here is much the same.

A two-finger swipe down from the top of the screen was all it took.”</p><p>OnePlus also sells a keyboard case and a stylus for the OnePlus Pad, which more or less turns the OnePlus Pad into an iPad Pro dupe.

You move it by double tapping in the blank space on either side of it.”</p><p>Not only is the app experience better with the Pixel Tablet, but it pulls double duty acting as a smart home hub when it’s not in use thanks to the included Charging Speaker Dock. The $129 accessory (if you want to buy extras) has a built-in speaker that ups the bass by 4x, while enabling a hub mode feature that effectively makes the Pixel Tablet more like a Nest Hub, instead of a tablet. </p><p>Unfortunately, right now, there isn’t any sort of official keyboard or stylus for those who want to get some work done on the Pixel Tablet.

And, the big draw of the iPad Pro was always its bigger size, but that benefit has now come downmarket to a price tier that’s much more accessible.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-air-2024-review/"><strong>Apple iPad Air (6th generation)</strong></a></p><p>Another standout feature is the iPad Air’s front-facing camera, which has been rotated to the side bezel for landscape mode, which means you’ll look a lot better during FaceTime calls.</p><p>Where the iPad Pro is the model for those who want nothing but the best, the iPad Air is the model for those who want to use the tablet for work and play, without big sacrifices in performance or features. In our review, we said the iPad Air is “where your search should begin and, likely, end” if you’re in the market for an iPad.</p><p><strong>Apple iPad Air tech specs: Display</strong>: 11-inch or 13-inch Liquid Retina IPS, 60Hz | <strong>Processor</strong>: Apple Silicon M2 | <strong>Storage</strong>: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB | <strong>Biometrics</strong>: Touch ID | <strong>Colors</strong>: Space gray, starlight, purple, blue | <strong>Cameras</strong>: 12MP rear camera, 12MP webcam (landscape-oriented) | <strong>Weight</strong>: 11-inch: 1.02 pounds, 13-inch: 1.36 pounds | <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 9.74 x 7.02 x 0.24 inches and 11.04 x 8.46 x .24 inches | <strong>Connections</strong>: USB-C port and magnetic connector for Apple Pencil Pro | <strong>Battery life:</strong> 10 hours</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/dp/B09BSRTHL7?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ce15219f5-3614-465e-b1d1-81d4610cbbfc%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amazon-kindle-scribe-digital-notebook-premium-pen-2022-gray/6522252.p?skuId=6522252&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Impressive battery life</li><li>Included pen for handwritten notes</li><li>Compatible with Microsoft Word</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Premium pen upgrade will cost you more</li><li>Does not support note-taking on magazines or newspapers</li></ul><h2 id="Amazon-Kindle-Scribe"><a href="#Amazon-Kindle-Scribe" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Kindle Scribe"></a>Amazon Kindle Scribe</h2><h3 id="Best-tablet-for-reading"><a href="#Best-tablet-for-reading" class="headerlink" title="Best tablet for reading"></a>Best tablet for reading</h3><p>The Kindle Scribe is perhaps the perfect example of part e-reader, part tablet to satisfy your reading and note-taking needs.

When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.</p><ul><li><strong>Display</strong>: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy.<br>We also compare the display’s performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen’s responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer’s stylus.</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet’s temperature during intensive tasks.</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong>: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.</li><li><strong>Camera and audio:</strong> For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.</li></ul><p>For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tablet testing methodology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vca--yEhtdo?si=7ijqjyP-oi3LYze1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-does-it-mean-if-a-tablet-is-Wi-Fi-only"><a href="#What-does-it-mean-if-a-tablet-is-Wi-Fi-only" class="headerlink" title="What does it mean if a tablet is Wi-Fi only?"></a>What does it mean if a tablet is Wi-Fi only?</h2><p>When a tablet says it is “Wi-Fi Only,” it requires a wireless internet connection to access things like email, websites, and apps. There are models available that give you the option to use LTE cellular data to connect to the internet, but if you aren’t planning on traveling with your tablet, you can stick to a Wi-Fi only model.</p><h2 id="Is-a-tablet-better-than-a-laptop"><a href="#Is-a-tablet-better-than-a-laptop" class="headerlink" title="Is a tablet better than a laptop?"></a>Is a tablet better than a laptop?</h2><p>That depends on what you want to use your tablet or laptop for. Digital artists tend to prefer tablets since they’re easier to draw on with a stylus. Tablets are also great for photo editing and streaming movies if you get one with a large enough screen size.
