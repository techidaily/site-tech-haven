Many people use ChatGPT to provide engaging conversations, answer queries, offer creative suggestions, and aid in coding and writing. However, ChatGPT is limited as you cannot store your data for long-term personal use, and its September 2021 knowledge data cutoff point.</p><p> As a workaround, we can use OpenAI’s API and LangChain to provide ChatGPT with custom data and updated info past 2021 to create a custom ChatGPT instance.</p><h2 id="Why-Provide-ChatGPT-with-Custom-Data"><a href="#Why-Provide-ChatGPT-with-Custom-Data" class="headerlink" title="Why Provide ChatGPT with Custom Data?"></a>Why Provide ChatGPT with Custom Data?</h2><p> Feeding ChatGPT with custom data and providing updated information beyond its knowledge cutoff date provides several benefits over just using ChatGPT as usual. Here are a few of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Personalized Interactions:</strong> By providing ChatGPT with custom data, users can create a more customized experience. The model can be trained on specific datasets relevant to individual users or organizations, resulting in responses tailored to their unique needs and preferences.</li><li><strong>Domain-Specific Expertise:</strong> Custom data integration allows ChatGPT to specialize in particular domains or industries. It can be trained on industry-specific knowledge, terminology, and trends, enabling more accurate and insightful responses within those specific areas.</li><li><strong>Current and Accurate Information:</strong> Access to updated information ensures that ChatGPT stays current with the latest developments and knowledge. It can provide accurate responses based on recent events, news, or research, making it a more reliable source of information.</li></ul><p> Now that you understand the importance of providing custom data to ChatGPT, here’s a step-by-step on how to do so on your local computer.</p><h2 id="Step-1-Install-and-Download-Software-and-Pre-Made-Script"><a href="#Step-1-Install-and-Download-Software-and-Pre-Made-Script" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Install and Download Software and Pre-Made Script"></a>Step 1: Install and Download Software and Pre-Made Script</h2><p> Please note the following instructions are for a Windows 10 or Windows 11 machine.</p><p> To provide custom data to ChatGPT, you’ll need to install and download the latest Python3, Git, Microsoft C++, and the ChatGPT-retrieval script from GitHub. If you already have some of the software installed on your PC, make sure they are updated with the latest version to avoid any hiccups during the process.</p><p>Start by installing:</p><ul><li><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" >Python3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</li><li><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" >Git <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</li><li><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/" >Microsoft Visual Build Tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</li></ul><h3 id="Python3-and-Microsoft-C-Installation-Notes"><a href="#Python3-and-Microsoft-C-Installation-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Python3 and Microsoft C++ Installation Notes"></a>Python3 and Microsoft C++ Installation Notes</h3><p> When installing Python3, make sure that you tick the<strong>Add python.exe to PATH</strong> option before clicking<strong>Install Now</strong> . This is important as it allows you to access Python in any directory on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1-download-python.jpg"                      alt="Adding Python to PATH"                ></p><p> When Installing Microsoft C++, you’ll want to install<strong>Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools</strong> first. Once installed, you can tick the<strong>Desktop development with C++</strong> option and click<strong>Install</strong> with all the optional tools automatically ticked on the right sidebar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2-install-c.jpg"                      alt="Installing Microsoft C++ through Build Tools"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SgRVYjqB70s?si=My_2cDvJVdincQRu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Now that you have installed the latest versions of Python3, Git, and Microsoft C++, you can download the Python script to easily query custom local data.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/techleadhd/chatgpt-retrieval" >ChatGPT-retrieval script <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><p> To download the script, click on<strong>Code,</strong> then select<strong>Download ZIP</strong> . This should download the Python script into your default or selected directory.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3-download-script.jpg"                      alt="Downloading Python script on GitHub"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U6lCtLUeROA?si=se6OFuis9JpcTGJf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Once downloaded, we can now set up a local environment.</p><h2 id="Step-2-Set-Up-the-Local-Environment"><a href="#Step-2-Set-Up-the-Local-Environment" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Set Up the Local Environment"></a>Step 2: Set Up the Local Environment</h2><p> To set up the environment, you’ll need to open a terminal in the chatgpt-retrieval-main folder you downloaded. To do that, open<strong>chatgpt-retrieval-main</strong> folder, right-click, and select<strong>Open in Terminal</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/4-open-terminal.jpg"                      alt="Opening terminal on directory folder"                ></p><p>Once the terminal is open, copy and paste this command:</p><p>pip install langchain openai chromadb tiktoken unstructured</p><p> This command uses Python’s package manager to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/create-manage-python-virtual-environments/" >create and manage the Python virtual environment <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> needed.</p><p> After creating the virtual environment, we need to supply an OpenAI API key to access their services. We’ll first need to generate an API key from the<a class="link"   href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys" >OpenAI API keys site <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by clicking on<strong>Create new secret key</strong> , adding a name for the key, then hitting the<strong>Create secret key button</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/generate-api-key.jpg"                      alt="Creating secret API key"                ></p><p> You will be provided with a string of characters. This is your OpenAI API key. Copy it by clicking on the copy icon on the side of the API key. Keep note that this API key should be kept secret. Do not share it with others unless you really intend for them to use it with you.</p><p> Once copied, return to the chatgpt-retrieval-main folder and open constants with<strong>Notepad</strong> . Now replace the placeholder with your API key. Remember to save the file!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/add-api-key.jpg"                      alt="Adding API key as environment variable"                ></p><p> Now that you have successfully set up your virtual environment and added your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. You can now provide your custom data to ChatGPT.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZblaBc-v2vs?si=CKW1gJwXQT2vZJYo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Step-3-Adding-Custom-Data"><a href="#Step-3-Adding-Custom-Data" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Adding Custom Data"></a>Step 3: Adding Custom Data</h2><p> To add custom data, place all your custom text data in the<strong>data</strong> folder within chatgpt-retrieval-main. The format of the text data may be in the form of a PDF, TXT, or DOC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/adding-data.jpg"                      alt="Adding custom data for ChatGPT"                ></p><p> As you can see from the screenshot above, I’ve added a text file containing a made-up personal schedule, an article I wrote on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-amd-instinct-ai-accelerators/" >AMD’s Instinct Accelerators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and a PDF document.</p><h2 id="Step-4-Querying-ChatGPT-Through-Terminal"><a href="#Step-4-Querying-ChatGPT-Through-Terminal" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Querying ChatGPT Through Terminal"></a>Step 4: Querying ChatGPT Through Terminal</h2><p> The Python script allows us to query data from the custom data we’ve added to the data folder and the internet. In other words, you will have access to the usual ChatGPT backend and all the data stored locally in the data folder.</p><p> To use the script, run the python<a class="link"   href="http://chatgpt.py/" >chatgpt.py <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> script and then add your question or query as the argument.</p><p>python <a class="link"   href="http://chatgpt.py/" >chatgpt.py <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> “YOUR QUESTION”</p><p>Make sure to put your questions in quotation marks.</p><p> To test if we have successfully fed ChatGPT our data, I’ll ask a personal question regarding the<strong>Personal Sched.txt</strong> file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/visit.jpg"                      alt="Testing ChatGPT with custom data"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZeYbTVeaXg0?si=rwLL1DbBoX26BGjm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> It worked! This means ChatGPT was able to read the Personal Sched.txt provided earlier. Now let’s see if we have successfully fed ChatGPT with information it does not know due to its knowledge cutoff date.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/m250x.jpg"                      alt="Asking custom ChatGPT about topic outside knowledge cut off data"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKFdFHaVIJg?si=x2vLw7ty3FtHX-9T" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> As you can see, it correctly described the AMD Instinct MI250x, which was released after ChatGPT -3’s knowledge cutoff date.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YCkNXJjC3c?si=9Tn8KiqKGTZi1o7E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Limitations-of-Custom-ChatGPT"><a href="#Limitations-of-Custom-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of Custom ChatGPT"></a>Limitations of Custom ChatGPT</h2><p> Although feeding GPT-3.5 with custom data opens more ways to apply and use the LLM, there are a few drawbacks and limitations.</p><p> Firstly, you need to provide all the data yourself. You can still access all the knowledge of GPT-3.5 until its knowledge cutoff date; however, you must provide all the extra data. This means if you want your local model to be knowledgeable of a certain subject on the internet that GPT-3.5 don’t already know, you’ll have to go to the internet and scrape the data yourself and save it as a text on the data folder of chatgpt-retrieval-main.</p><p> Another issue is that querying ChatGPT like this takes more time to load when compared to asking ChatGPT directly.</p><p> Lastly, the only model currently available is GPT-3.5 Turbo. So even if you have access to GPT-4, you won’t be able to use it to power your custom ChatGPT instance.</p><h2 id="Custom-ChatGPT-Is-Awesome-But-Limited"><a href="#Custom-ChatGPT-Is-Awesome-But-Limited" class="headerlink" title="Custom ChatGPT Is Awesome But Limited"></a>Custom ChatGPT Is Awesome But Limited</h2><p> Providing custom data to ChatGPT is a powerful way to get more out of the model. Through this method, you can feed the model with any text data you want and prompt it just like regular ChatGPT, albeit with some limitations. However, this will change in the future as it becomes easier to integrate our data with the LLM, along with access to the latest GPT-4 model.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-luminous-transitions-crafting-dynamic-colors/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Luminous Transitions Crafting Dynamic Colors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-download-free-mcb-logo-templates/"><u>[Updated] Download Free MCB Logo Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/elevate-your-wheel-to-peak-performance-using-gpt/"><u>Elevate Your Wheel to Peak Performance Using GPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/enhancing-mouse-functionality-with-latest-hid-standard-driver-updates/"><u>Enhancing Mouse Functionality with Latest HID Standard Driver Updates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-use-allshare-cast-to-turn-on-screen-mirroring-on-vivo-v30-lite-5g-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Use Allshare Cast To Turn On Screen Mirroring On Vivo V30 Lite 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://novels-ebooks.techidaily.com/210336917-9781789044041-practically-pagan-an-alternative-guide-to-magical-living/"><u>Practically Pagan - An Alternative Guide to Magical Living | Free Book</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/the-elite-6-big-data-language-algorithms-you-need-to-know-about/"><u>The Elite 6 Big Data Language Algorithms You Need to Know About</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/unleashing-creativity-in-writing-a-guide-to-leveraging-chatgpt/"><u>Unleashing Creativity in Writing: A Guide to Leveraging ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/unlock-productivity-6-essential-uses-of-chatgpt-for-independent-workers/"><u>Unlock Productivity: 6 Essential Uses of ChatGPT for Independent Workers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/upcoming-iphone-model-17-price-predictions-arrival-date-technical-details-and-fresh-gossip-overview/"><u>Upcoming iPhone Model 17: Price Predictions, Arrival Date, Technical Details & Fresh Gossip Overview</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

ChatGPT can be applied in so many ways, but what about smart technology? Can ChatGPT work with your smartphone, smart speaker, and similar devices?</p><p> Let’s start with your smartphone. You can, indeed, use ChatGPT on your smartphone in the same way you’d use it on a desktop by simply accessing the tool via your web browser. You can even use ChatGPT on your smartwatch by using certain plugins,</p><p> But to make ChatGPT useful in a smart home, things can’t stop at one device alone. ChatGPT must be able to recognize and communicate with other smart devices, such as lights, locks, heating, and other appliances. So, is this possible yet?</p><h2 id="Can-ChatGPT-Work-In-Smart-Homes"><a href="#Can-ChatGPT-Work-In-Smart-Homes" class="headerlink" title="Can ChatGPT Work In Smart Homes?"></a>Can ChatGPT Work In Smart Homes?</h2><p> As you may know, ChatGPT is a language processing tool, and is therefore trained to understand natural human language. The main service processes natural language in text form, but there are extensions that let you communicate with ChatGPT using your voice, such as<a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/voice-control-for-chatgpt/eollffkcakegifhacjnlnegohfdlidhn" >Voice Control for ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This allows you to supply ChatGPT with prompts using your voice instead of text inputs.</p><p> ChatGPT can be used in your smart home if you integrate it with the assistant you’re using. The video above shows a YouTube creator’s custom home integration system that uses ChatGPT. This system uses GPT-3, an older model of ChatGPT that predates GPT-4. It is also designed to work solely with Home Assistant, an open-source smart home program.</p><p> The creator, known as HassAssistant,<a class="link"   href="http://github.com/Hassassistant/openai%5Fresponse" >posted the repository to GitHub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . On this page, he provides a link to the ChatGPT API key required to access the voice control integration.</p><p> But this isn’t where things end. Another online creator and developer, Alex Capecelatro, posted a video to YouTube testing out a ChatGPT voice control integration with Josh.ai, a system that he, along with others, co-founded.</p><p> Josh.ai is a company that produces AI voice control tools. Specifically, Josh.ai focuses on combining AI-powered voice control with smart home technology.</p><p> On<a class="link"   href="https://www.josh.ai/" >Josh.ai’s website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it is stated that:</p><blockquote><p>By utilizing advanced AI technologies, including natural interfaces like voice and touch, Josh orchestrates the technology in all aspects of your home to deliver an exciting and effortless living experience.</p></blockquote><p> In the above video, you’ll see Josh being asked to open blinds, give the local weather forecast, and even provide sleep advice. Josh also answered more complex questions, like which museums in California feature Andy Warhol. While this is still a work in progress, there’s a lot of potential for ChatGPT to show off its skills within smart homes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iz2LYWd8EqI?si=G_3CqFRAmeVPczjj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Using-ChatGPT-to-Create-a-Smart-Home-Integration"><a href="#Using-ChatGPT-to-Create-a-Smart-Home-Integration" class="headerlink" title="Using ChatGPT to Create a Smart Home Integration"></a>Using ChatGPT to Create a Smart Home Integration</h3><p> You can also<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-vs-code-chatgpt-extensions/" >use ChatGPT to write code <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a smart home integration.</p><p> ChatGPT can write various kinds of code in various different languages, and is already being used by software engineers and novices to lend a helping hand in code development. While this is often relatively simple code, it could still be of use to you.</p><p> We asked ChatGPT if it could write some code for smart home integration, and it was happy to help. In fact, ChatGPT provided detailed instructions on how to use a Python-based code template for Home Assistant.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-smart-code-0.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt chat response featuring code example"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nyp7-xVwqHA?si=XCuZbpKLFIdrGQQh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> As you can see above, ChatGPT provided an example of integration code you can use with Home Assistant, as well as steps on how to get it working for you.

Evidently, there are a lot of different smart home assistants that can function with ChatGPT’s capabilities.</p><p> However, you’ll need some understanding of software code if you want to personalize ChatGPT’s provided code templates quite a lot (e.g. if you want it to work with multiple smart assistants simultaneously).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qn1XkPJde9Y?si=i6ZJARXO8sJhy2FV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Using-ChatGPT-In-Your-Smart-Home"><a href="#Using-ChatGPT-In-Your-Smart-Home" class="headerlink" title="Using ChatGPT In Your Smart Home"></a>Using ChatGPT In Your Smart Home</h2><p> At the moment, it’s not super easy to use ChatGPT in your smart home, simply because the concept itself is pretty new. There isn’t a dedicated app for ChatGPT smart home integration, though independent developers have come up with their own tools that you can check out. If you want to try implementing the code yourself, ChatGPT can help you, but this will require a little work on your end, too.</p><p> In the description of the Josh.ai and ChatGPT YouTube video, it was stated that there were delays the creator edited out, as ChatGPT was taking a little while to respond. These early ChatGPT smart home integrations aren’t perfect yet, and there’s likely a way to go before they’re fully equipped to operate all your smart home tech correctly and efficiently.</p><p> However, if you’re an expert with tech, you may be able to leverage ChatGPT within your smart home by using a GitHub repository, or writing your own code (possibly by<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-by-openai/" >using ChatGPT itself <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).</p><p> But ChatGPT-enabled smart assistants may one day be widespread, allowing you to carry out all sorts of tasks using this nifty AI tool.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-May-One-Day-Control-Your-Smart-Home"><a href="#ChatGPT-May-One-Day-Control-Your-Smart-Home" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT May One Day Control Your Smart Home"></a>ChatGPT May One Day Control Your Smart Home</h2><p> ChatGPT is representative of how versatile one AI system can be. With just a little coding, this language processing tool can be integrated into your smart home on a range of virtual assistants. In the near future, commercial ChatGPT integration may also be available, streamlining the process for those who aren’t too tech-savvy.</p><p> If you’re interested in using ChatGPT as a smart home tool, check out the integration options above.

If you want accurate, useful information from an AI chatbot, crafting a prompt properly is important.</p><p> But it’s not always easy. How specific should you be? What information should you include? And how do you request your data in a useful format?</p><p> A whole new world of prompt engineering is springing into life, all dedicated to crafting and perfecting the art of AI prompting. But you can skip the tricky bits and improve your AI prompting game with these tips and tricks.</p><h2 id="1-Be-as-Specific-as-Possible"><a href="#1-Be-as-Specific-as-Possible" class="headerlink" title="1 Be as Specific as Possible"></a>1 Be as Specific as Possible</h2><p> One<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-prompt-mistakes-to-avoid/" >ChatGPT prompt mistake <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is not being specific with the information you give, and this is also a problem when using Microsoft Copilot and other AI tools. If you want AI to provide more accurate results, you need to tell it exactly what you’re looking for.p</p><p> For example, let’s say that you want your AI tool to generate a new gym workout plan. If you simply say something like, “Please create a gym plan for five days per week,” you’ll get generic results. Instead, a better prompt is:</p><blockquote><p>“Please create a fitness and diet plan that involves five workouts per week. I want to combine weightlifting with high-intensity interval training and have been regularly exercising for 10 years. I’m 28 years old, 6 ft, and 90 kilograms. I don’t have any allergies, but I am sensitive to rice and don’t want to drink alcohol.”</p></blockquote><p> As you can see below, we’ve received more of a customized workout plan with the types of exercises that we wanted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-12-59-46.png"                      alt="A gym routine generated with ChatGPT"                ></p><p> The more context you provide your AI tool, the better of a response you’ll receive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qmQjRcnaq9g?si=jadcGtXemUAlKOTa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Ask-for-More-Information-After-Getting-an-Initial-Answer"><a href="#2-Ask-for-More-Information-After-Getting-an-Initial-Answer" class="headerlink" title="2 Ask for More Information After Getting an Initial Answer"></a>2 Ask for More Information After Getting an Initial Answer</h2><p> As you use tools like ChatGPT more frequently, you’ll quickly learn that the first answer you get shouldn’t always be taken as is. In the same way that you’d ask a person further questions to get more information out of them, you should do the same when prompting with AI.</p><p> This time, we’ve asked our AI tool to give us a three-day San Francisco itinerary for a couple’s trip. Using the first tip mentioned in this guide and being more specific, we got a pretty good outline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-13-06-24.png"                      alt="An itinerary generated with ChatGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNrOsjUdRz0?si=xGzhmNmtgxNTsRxN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> However, I wanted to get further information that wasn’t included. So, I asked for hotel recommendations within a customized budget:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-13-11-12.png"                      alt="An expanded answer with ChatGPT"                ></p><p> As a general rule of thumb, ask as many questions as you feel necessary to get all the information you’re looking for. You may also want to determine<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/should-you-buy-ai-prompts/" >whether premium AI prompts are worth the money <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="3-Explain-What-Hasn’t-Worked-When-You’ve-Prompted-in-the-Past"><a href="#3-Explain-What-Hasn’t-Worked-When-You’ve-Prompted-in-the-Past" class="headerlink" title="3 Explain What Hasn’t Worked When You’ve Prompted in the Past"></a>3 Explain What Hasn’t Worked When You’ve Prompted in the Past</h2><p> As you use AI prompting more frequently, you’ll get a better idea of what does and doesn’t work for you. You’ll also learn which prompts are useful and which ones confuse the tool that you’re using. Once you’ve become more familiar with AI, make sure that you clearly outline what hasn’t worked before.</p><p> This tip is especially important if you want to use AI tools like DALL-E 3 to generate images. I’ve often noticed that first drafts sometimes don’t yield what I’m looking for, and there could also be problems like defects for items like flags.</p><p> Besides mentioning what hasn’t worked for you when prompting in the past, you may also wish to outline anything that has not worked with what you’re trying to do. For example, if you’re putting together a new workout regimen, you may want to talk about which foods you’ve noticed you have a negative reaction to before.</p><h2 id="4-Don’t-Make-Your-AI-Multitask"><a href="#4-Don’t-Make-Your-AI-Multitask" class="headerlink" title="4 Don’t Make Your AI Multitask"></a>4 Don’t Make Your AI Multitask</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/7dd47039b908f15adfac56204ff22ad7becb8a002a35f04201c966ce7066b460.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt logo and message on smartphone feature"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omWG4u39lmE?si=yk1AEo_gzDpGjYbl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Ascannio&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/chatgpt-chat-bot-screen-seen-on-2237655785" >Shutterstock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/mistakes-generative-ai-tools/" >Avoiding common mistakes when using AI prompting tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> isn’t always easy, but one of the main issues you’ll encounter is trying to make the tool multitask. AI programs will often generate your results within a few minutes, but they can only do one thing at a time. If you try to ask too many things in one go, you won’t get the results you want.</p><p> Sometimes, you’ll begin a prompt and realize you forgot to add further information. When this happens, stop or edit the current prompt and include those details before re-generating your answer.</p><p> Once you’ve received one prompt’s results, you can move on to the next one until you’re happy with everything. Doing things this way might seem more time-consuming, but<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/master-single-tasking-using-technology-improve-productivity/" >single-tasking often improves productivity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it’s the same for your AI, too.</p><h2 id="5-Tell-Your-AI-Tool-What-You-Don’t-Want-in-Your-Answer"><a href="#5-Tell-Your-AI-Tool-What-You-Don’t-Want-in-Your-Answer" class="headerlink" title="5 Tell Your AI Tool What You Don’t Want in Your Answer"></a>5 Tell Your AI Tool What You Don’t Want in Your Answer</h2><p> Do you remember in our first point when we told you to be as specific as possible? This also means you should let your AI tool know what you don’t want in your answers. While generative AI can produce some pretty cool results, it can’t guess everything for you.</p><p> When designing your prompt, be very specific about what you don’t want in your results. For example, if you’re planning a trip, you may want to mention that you don’t want to join tours or would prefer to avoid popular spots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-13-38-46.png"                      alt="Answer options from ChatGPT, based on what the user did and didn&#39;t want "                ></p><p> Sometimes, your AI tool will give you multiple options in your answers. You can then choose whichever one works best for you.</p><h2 id="6-Upload-Images-or-Files-if-Available"><a href="#6-Upload-Images-or-Files-if-Available" class="headerlink" title="6 Upload Images or Files (if Available)"></a>6 Upload Images or Files (if Available)</h2><p> Uploading images or files will often make your AI prompts much more effective. For example, if you want to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/create-one-page-resume/" >create a one-page resume with AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it’s worth uploading an existing PDF and getting feedback. You can use several plugins to get better responses, especially if you use ChatGPT. One example is<a class="link"   href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-MrgKnTZbc-resume" >Resume by jobbright.ai <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> If you’re using AI to create art, it’s also a good idea to upload images that the AI tool can use as examples. Meanwhile, if you want to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-photo-ai/" >use Photo AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or similar tools for pictures of yourself, uploading selfies, headshots, and other images will help you achieve what you want.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-tools-answer-pdf/" >Some AI tools can even answer questions from your PDFs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to get more clarity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f3PFn06LijE?si=zHrmlTOzrKxXe-k4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Mention-Where-You-Want-to-Use-Your-Prompt-Answers"><a href="#7-Mention-Where-You-Want-to-Use-Your-Prompt-Answers" class="headerlink" title="7 Mention Where You Want to Use Your Prompt Answers"></a>7 Mention Where You Want to Use Your Prompt Answers</h2><p> Sometimes, the results your AI prompts generate won’t be useful for the place you want to use them. For example, if you want to create a post for Instagram, you probably don’t want your tool to provide huge bodies of text. On the other hand, you might want something more formal if you’re going to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/linkedin-how-to-improve-profile-with-ai/" >improve your LinkedIn profile with AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> If you use the information from your AI prompt online, it’s worth specifically mentioning where you’ll use it.

It features an adjustable stand with 8 configurations, a bumper and rugged shell for added drop protection, a stylus pocket, wireless charging capabilities, and more. Plus, Zugu has cases available for preorder for the new M4 iPad Pro models. </p><p>I tested this Zugu case on my iPad Air (pictured above) for the past few weeks along with several other cases, it’s my favorite. It’s extremely functional but still practical, providing true security from bumps and drops (not just operating as a light cover). I loved using it as a stand, especially while testing several note-taking apps this month. The material feels premium and expensive with a clean, appealing design. </p><p>And while the functionality is top-notch, my favorite thing about the Zugu case is the color. I’ve been using the case in the Desert Rose color, and as a true Gen-Z corporate girl, I love it. Many companies don’t cater to colors outside of black, white, tan, and brown, so the unique color choices are awesome, but I still wish there were more fun prints and designs. The new iPad Pro model cases also have limited colors for now, but I expect to see more soon.</p><p>Current customers on the Zugu website said they like the overall protection, functionality, quality, and aesthetic of the Zugu case. Many said the case is a great value and has a premium feel, and one customer even said they wished they’d found Zugu sooner. </p><p>What’s even better is that Zugu will pay a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zugucase.com/pages/free-ipad-repairs" >one-time AppleCare+ repair fee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if your iPad is damaged while in a Zugu case. The Zugu case is well worth the money in my opinion, and it’s a solid all-around case for style and protection.</p><p><strong>Zugu iPad Pro Case features:</strong> Adjustable stand with 8 angles | Bumper and rugged shell for drop protection | Air flow vents | Secure magnetic mount capability | Microfiber interior | Auto sleep&#x2F;wake magnetic cover | Stylus pocket on back | Wireless Apple Pencil charging compatibility | Free AppleCare+ Repair Fee</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://burga.sjv.io/c/159047/1270603/15631?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%253A%252F%252Fus.burga.com%252Fproducts%252Fmath-exam-ipad-pro-12-9-6th-5th-gen-case%253Fvariant%253D47811892412744%2526type%253DFolio&subId1=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp" >View now at Burga <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Fun designs and patterns</li><li>Folio style</li><li>Apple Pencil storage&#x2F;charging</li><li>Doubles as stand</li><li>Under $100</li><li>Shock absorption</li><li>Raised bezel design</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Stand configurations could be more comfortable</li><li>Folio front feels a bit flimsy</li><li>No cases for new 13-inch iPad Pro</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GFHH14XlFCk?si=2HcjQbDx5eG0ZQAt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Burga-iPad-Pro-Case"><a href="#Burga-iPad-Pro-Case" class="headerlink" title="Burga iPad Pro Case"></a>Burga iPad Pro Case</h2><h3 id="Best-basic-iPad-Pro-case-for-style"><a href="#Best-basic-iPad-Pro-case-for-style" class="headerlink" title="Best basic iPad Pro case for style"></a>Best basic iPad Pro case for style</h3><p>Burga’s folio case for the iPad Pro combines style and function. It features a spot for stylus storage and Apple Pencil charging, has a hard shell backing and a soft close folio front, can be used as stand for your iPad, features shock absorption and a raised bezel design, and is overall sleek in profile. </p><p>When I tested the Burga case on the iPad Air the last few weeks (pictured above) I liked its light weight, handy Apple Pencil storage, folio style cover, stand configuration, and numerous prints and designs. It’s a great basic case to protect from everyday bumps and scratches, but I recommend bumping up to something more secure such as an Otterbox or even the Zugu case if you’re accident prone or are more rough around the edges when it comes to your tech. </p><p>I also wish the stand options on the case were a bit more comfortable for viewing, though it’s a nice add to have the option to prop up my iPad up at all while watching a show or video. For the $60 price tag though, I think this a great buy for the features you are getting, especially considering a similar folio case from Apple is now around $80 and ones at Casetify start at $92. </p><p>Current customers on the Burga website said they like the overall value of the case, with emphasis on the case’s design, build, and and quality. Many said they enjoyed the fun patterns and color options – which outdo most other case mentioned on this list in the color department, and compete with the likes of only Casetify. </p><p><strong>Burga iPad Pro Case features:</strong> Raised bezel design for camera and screen protection | Apple Pencil storage and charging spot | Variety of colors and styles | Shock absorbing bumper | Stand configurations | Never-fading prints </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/159047/499820/8585?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/combo-touch-ipad-pro.html?sp=1&searchclick=logi&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Logitech <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Combo-Touch-iPad-12-9-inch/dp/B0938C32PZ?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ccba8fb36-139e-4589-8276-051d3b56b505%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Combo-Touch-iPad-11-inch/dp/B0937Z63SR?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ccba8fb36-139e-4589-8276-051d3b56b505%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Detachable keyboard</li><li>Trackpad</li><li>Stylus storage</li><li>Backlit keys</li><li>More affordable than Apple’s Magic Keyboard</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Slightly heavy</li><li>Still pricey</li><li>Limited color options</li></ul><h2 id="Logitech-Combo-Touch-Keyboard-Case"><a href="#Logitech-Combo-Touch-Keyboard-Case" class="headerlink" title="Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard Case"></a>Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard Case</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DJKH1uY7P0?si=tCG66XVlbwSKoATj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-iPad-Pro-keyboard-case"><a href="#Best-iPad-Pro-keyboard-case" class="headerlink" title="Best iPad Pro keyboard case"></a>Best iPad Pro keyboard case</h3><p>The Logitech Combo Touch is our pick for the best overall iPad Pro keyboard case thanks to its top features and affordable price. The Combo touch is packed full of function thanks to a detachable keyboard, backlit keys, built-in stylus storage, iPad OS shortcut keys, and more. It offers four modes of use (type, view, sketch, and read) to suit iany of your iPad activities. </p><p><strong>Review: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/logitech-combo-touch-crayon-review/" >My favorite iPad keyboard and stylus are not made by Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>When ZDNET’s Senior Reviews Editor Kerry Wan tested the Combo Touch and Logitech Crayon Stylus with the iPad 10th Gen back in 2022, he lauded its ability to “flex on the Magic Keyboard [Folio].” </p><p>“Logitech’s Combo Touch cover and Crayon stylus for the iPad are cheaper and practically better than Apple’s own accessories. [They] are not perfect, but they deliver a more feature-rich experience than Apple’s first-party accessories at a fraction of the cost. That’s not a knock on Apple’s own iPad keyboard and stylus by any means; the two are just as worthy of your consideration,” Wan wrote in <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/logitech-combo-touch-crayon-review/" >his review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>Current customers on the Logitech website said they liked the top of the line features, overall value, and price point of the Combo Touch case, which has over 100 5&#x2F;5 star reviews. One customer, like Wan, even said it beat out Apple’s own Magic Keyboard. “This product is exactly what I hoped Apple was going to provide. And, it was at a fraction of the price,” they wrote. </p><p><strong>Logitech Combo Touch</strong> <strong>features</strong>: 4 modes (type, view, sketch, read) | Detachable keyboard | Backlit keys | Stylus storage | Full row of iPad OS shortcut keys | 1-year limited warranty | Two viewing angles</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/otterbox-defender-series-pro-for-apple-ipad-pro-12-9-6th-gen-5th-gen-4th-gen-and-3rd-gen-black/6453122.p?skuId=6453122&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/protective-ipad-pro-11-inch-m4-case-black/77-95237.html" >View now at Otterbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/protective-ipad-pro-13-inch-m4-case-black/77-95232.html" >View now at Otterbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Durability</li><li>Edge protection</li><li>Port covers</li><li>Excellent protection against dirt and grime</li><li>Rugged build</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>No color options</li><li>A bit bulky</li></ul><h2 id="OtterBox-Defender"><a href="#OtterBox-Defender" class="headerlink" title="OtterBox Defender"></a>OtterBox Defender</h2><h3 id="Best-iPad-Pro-case-for-max-durability"><a href="#Best-iPad-Pro-case-for-max-durability" class="headerlink" title="Best iPad Pro case for max durability"></a>Best iPad Pro case for max durability</h3><p>Some people use their iPads to scroll on the couch, but others need a tablet in the field. Whether you work in construction, utilities, or another boots-on-the-ground industry, you might want your iPad Pro to be able to venture out with you. Enter: the OtterBox Defender Series Pro Case. </p><p>With raised edges, it offers drop protection for your screen and camera.

Moft makes some of the most innovate, origami-inspired mobile and tech accessories I’ve seen. </p><p>The Moft Snap Float Folio case features a strong magnetic connection with a sleek and slim design that makes the case feel elevated and premium. The stylus holder is a plus, and the case configures into three different angled positions. One standing position is an ultra high alignment (as pictured) which lifts your iPad up above much of the competitors. </p><p>The case is a duo system, so you can customize which parts you want to use at any given time. There’s a soft outside folio and a hard case set for extra protection. They can be used individually or together, and it’s easy to change. I tested the Moft case for the last month on my iPad Air, and I especially liked the standing configuration, which allowed it to be eye-level. It’s perfect for working from home or personal video calls. I also enjoyed the premium look and feel, which is certainly more elevated than some other case options on this list. One downside right now is there is no iPad Pro 13-inch case available.</p><p>Current Moft Float Folio users said they like the overall design and quality feel of the case, as well as the functionality thanks to the unique stand configurations. One customer even said Moft cases deserved more hype than they get. “It’s the best case and holder ever. The quality of materials is great, the finishes are great. You can put it in any position you’re thinking of and your iPad is very well protected too. Simply the best. This product should be better known,” the customer wrote.</p><p><strong>Moft Snap Float Folio Case</strong> <strong>features</strong>: Stylus holder | Three unique stand configurations (one ultra high) | Premium construction and feel | Slim profile | Duo case set | Affordable luxury style </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f3PFn06LijE?si=zHrmlTOzrKxXe-k4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-the-best-iPad-Pro-case"><a href="#What-is-the-best-iPad-Pro-case" class="headerlink" title="What is the best iPad Pro case?"></a>What is the best iPad Pro case?</h2><p>The best iPad Pro case overall is the Zugu iPad Pro case thanks to its great warrant, top features, and maximum protection.

Check the size of the case to ensure that it will fit your iPad model, so it won’t be too small or too large.</li><li><strong>Build:</strong> iPad cases and covers can be made out of many different materials. The best iPad Pro cases and covers incorporate durable materials like rubber and polycarbonate plastic. Some are even rated for drop protection, providing an extra level of durability and security for your device.</li><li><strong>Features</strong>: Not all cases are created equal, and they don’t all offer the same features. Consider if you will want or need a trackpad or keyboard, stylus holder, adjustable stand, or other features to help narrow down your search and make it easier to find your top contenders. You don’t want to purchase a case that doesn’t fit your wants and needs.</li><li><strong>Design:</strong> Why not add a little style to your iPad Pro? Many of the best iPad Pro cases and covers are available in a variety of different colors and patterns so you can add a splash of personality to your everyday carry, if that’s what you’re looking for.</li><li><strong>Budget:</strong> There are many affordable iPad Pro cases available, but there are also some that cost well over $100, depending on the design and features. Setting a budget for yourself can will help narrow your search parameters.</li></ul><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-iPad-Pro-cases"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-iPad-Pro-cases" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these iPad Pro cases?"></a>How did we choose these iPad Pro cases?</h2><p>We chose these iPad Pro case options after extensive research into the product category and by going hands-on with some of these products.

The 2022 iPad Pro is available in either an 11-inch or 12.9-inch display. Apple’s newly announced Pro models are either an 11-inch or 13-inch display, which means that it’s likely many existing 11-inch cases may work for the new model, but the 12.9-inch iPad Pro cases won’t perfectly work with the new 13-inch iPad Pro. </p><p>We suggest selecting a case that is specifically designed for your iPad’s display size, and we anticipate more case options for the new iPad models to hit the market soon. </p><h2 id="Is-there-a-new-Magic-Keyboard-for-iPad-Pro"><a href="#Is-there-a-new-Magic-Keyboard-for-iPad-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Is there a new Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro?"></a>Is there a new Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro?</h2><p>Yes, there is a new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro.

The Nomad Sport Case is our pick for the best iPhone 16 case overall to help sheath your new phone.</p><p>ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner is a big fan of the Nomad brand. He ranks the Nomad Sport Case as the best phone case for the iPhone 15 Pro, praising it for its sleek design and lightweight feel. “I love how light these cases are. Combined with the noticeably lighter iPhone 15 Pro Max, it feels refreshingly light to hold,” Hiner says. Due to the similarities of the 15th and 16th generation of iPhones, the Nomad Sport Case will serve the iPhone 16 just as well.</p><p>This light case also offers enough drop protection and raised edges to keep the sensitive parts of your phone safe without a rugged or bulky feel. It provides protection with elegance, making it a perfect resting place for the sword – or new iPhone 16 – that is now in your hands. The Nomad Sport case is the perfect mix between lightweight and protective. Nomad also uses ethically-sourced material.</p><p><strong>Nomad Sport Case features:</strong> Comes in four colors | 8 feet of drop protection | MagSafe passthrough</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6GGF2JP?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cad37bf78-eb8c-49c4-99ed-c5bcf0b78358%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>MagSafe and magnetic</li><li>Drop protection</li><li>Kickstand</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Kickstand durability</li><li>Not many color options</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/15Ju8Cb4UZ8?si=5wdiQXdz1BOxIkDH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Torras-360-degree-OStand"><a href="#Torras-360-degree-OStand" class="headerlink" title="Torras 360-degree OStand"></a>Torras 360-degree OStand</h2><h3 id="Best-kickstand-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#Best-kickstand-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="Best kickstand iPhone 16 case"></a>Best kickstand iPhone 16 case</h3><p>Torras cases have always been a ZDNET favorite: Hiner called the Ostand case for the iPhone 15 “the most versatile and innovative of the bunch.” The newest version fit for the iPhone 16 follows in its footsteps. </p><p>ZDNET Reviews Editor Kerry Wan went hands-on with the Torras case for the iPhone 16 and found it to be super convenient for a few reasons, “for something more multifunctional, Torras’ 360-degree OStand case has a MagSafe ring on the back that keeps compatible accessories attached to the iPhone at virtually every angle. You can also pull out and rotate the ring for an optimal, on-the-go viewing experience.”</p><p>Reddit users agree, with one saying, “The overall production and material quality of the cases is excellent.

Many protective cases have this problem, making them hard to grasp and stick in your pocket. A Pitaka Ultra phone case will fix this problem.</p><p>The Pitaka brand boasts thin promises for their cases, and they follow through. ZDNET’s Kerry Wan finds it unique but weighs its pros and cons, “Pitaka is one of the originators of the ultra-thin Aramid Fiber case that you see so many brands remix today. With such cases, you’re trading drop protection in favor of slimness and minimalism, two aspects that should help reduce any discomfort when handling the larger iPhone 16 models.”</p><p>Aramid fibers, which is virtually the same as Kevlar, the fabric used in bulletproof vests and aircraft panels. Therefore, the case is durable, scratch-resistant, and protects from everyday wear and tear. If you are looking to find something protective, unique, and thin for your phone, give Pitaka a go. But beware, drop protection is not guaranteed. </p><p><strong>Pitaka Ultra Slim for iPhone 16</strong> <strong>features:</strong> MagSafe capabilities | Ultra-thin form factor | Camera protection | Aramid fiber material</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D78GQLKK?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cad37bf78-eb8c-49c4-99ed-c5bcf0b78358%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/11385907926&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Low price</li><li>Grippy texture</li><li>Clear and design options</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Low drop protection</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6xXIR_Uh1A?si=TMXzklPEY50MUM05" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Smartish-Gripmunk-case"><a href="#Smartish-Gripmunk-case" class="headerlink" title="Smartish Gripmunk case"></a>Smartish Gripmunk case</h2><h3 id="Best-cheap-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#Best-cheap-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="Best cheap iPhone 16 case"></a>Best cheap iPhone 16 case</h3><p>Sometimes, the price of a new iPhone leaves you with little money to buy a case. Luckily, there are great options that are less than $25 but serve just as well as the more expensive cases. This is why the Smartish Gripmunk case is our favorite cheap iPhone 16 case.</p><p>It has all the features of higher-end cases- grips on the sides, MagSafe capabilities, scratch resistance, and around 6 feet of drop protection. </p><p>“One of the more affordable options, with a grippy texture along the sides to prevent your phone from slipping out of your hands. I’d especially recommend the Clearly Black variant to anyone who wants to show off their iPhone 16 color – and you definitely should – without worrying about the case yellowing,” said expert tester Kerry Wan.</p><p><strong>Smartish Gripmunk case features:</strong> 6 ft drop protection | MagSafe | Side grips | Camera, screen, and corner protection</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCG3PFFD?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cad37bf78-eb8c-49c4-99ed-c5bcf0b78358%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Super protective</li><li>45 ft drop protection</li><li>Style options</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Pricier</li></ul><h2 id="Mous-Limitless-6-0"><a href="#Mous-Limitless-6-0" class="headerlink" title="Mous Limitless 6.0"></a>Mous Limitless 6.0</h2><h3 id="Best-protective-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#Best-protective-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="Best protective iPhone 16 case"></a>Best protective iPhone 16 case</h3><p>Nothing is more disappointing than dropping and shattering your brand-new device, especially if you chose not to opt for Apple Care. If you handle your device with little grace, a protective phone case may be a great preventative option. Our pick, the Mous Limitless 6.0, protects and offers style in one product, so you don’t have to sacrifice either.</p><p>The case features reinforced corners with their AiroShock technology for ultimate drop protection, which they claim offers 45ft of drop protection. Kerry Wan, who tested out the case, says, “Mous’ Limitless 6.0 series is one of the more stylish cases I’ve tested, with plenty of cushioning for drop protection. There’s a generous cut-out for the iPhone 16’s Camera Control and the case is offered in various backplates, including Walnut, Bamboo, Leather, and Carbon Fibre. It’s my worth-the-splurge pick.”</p><p>If you find yourself doing more accidental damage to your phone than normal, it may be worth a look into the Mous Limitless 6.0.</p><p><strong>Mous Limitless 6.0 features:</strong> AiroShock 45 ft drop protection | MagSafe | 9 style options | Raised edges</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDLZGM2B?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cad37bf78-eb8c-49c4-99ed-c5bcf0b78358%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Drop protection</li><li>Raised edges</li><li>Sustainable materials</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Pricier</li><li>No camera protection</li></ul><h2 id="Incase-Icon"><a href="#Incase-Icon" class="headerlink" title="Incase Icon"></a>Incase Icon</h2><h3 id="Best-stylish-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#Best-stylish-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="Best stylish iPhone 16 case"></a>Best stylish iPhone 16 case</h3><p>Incase makes great laptop cases, and its designs for iPhone are no different. To best summarize this case, Reddit users describe the Incase Icon as “awesome” and “sexy.” </p><p>The case retails for $60 and does not feature the standard plastic or silicone build, but rather a woven design. Many people stick to the former, “but if you prefer the FineWoven feel of last year’s iPhone cases, check out the Incase Icon, which comes in a fancy Woolenex finish. The material is lined to be weather-repellant and tear-resistant, but the more impressive part is that it doesn’t add much bulk or weight to the iPhone,” says reviews editor Kerry Wan, who tested the case.</p><p>The Incase Icon has raised edges for screen protection, press-fit buttons, MagSafe capabilities, and 10 feet of drop protection. The case has two material options, plant-based corn leather (which comes in Pebbled Obsidian, Pebbled Cocoa, and Pebbled Oat Milk) and Woolenex woven blend (which comes in Graphite, Navy, Blush Pink, Cosmic Red, and Asphalt).

Moft’s Snap Case Movas is our solution to that problem.</p><p>The vegan leather finish does not have the grain that traditional leather sports, but rather a smoother texture and five color options– Misty Cove, Jet Black, Taupe, Earthen Beige, and Cement. </p><p>ZDNET’s reviews editor Kerry Wan says, “while Apple didn’t replace its FineWoven cases with a vegan leather option this year, Moft’s Snap Case is a worthy alternative. The company’s Snap Phone Tripod Stand is a crowd-favorite among ZDNET editors, and its Snap Case is just as appreciable. The soft-touch finish contrasts well with the hard-brushed buttons, and there’s just enough spacing left for the Camera Control and charging port.” </p><p>Although it is not a protective case, it is a stylish alternative if you prefer leather or woven cases. </p><p><strong>Moft Snap Case Movas features:</strong> Vegan leather | MagSafe | Five color options</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/stores/NOMAD/page/6927BCAB-A05E-40FA-ADA7-1E37C46F23E5?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cad37bf78-eb8c-49c4-99ed-c5bcf0b78358%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9041660-15735858?url=https%253A%252F%252Fnomadgoods.com%252Fproducts%252Fmodern-leather-case-rustic-brown-horween-iphone-16-pro-max&sid=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp" >View now at Nomad Goods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Worn-in leather material</li><li>MagSafe capabilities</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Unsure on sustainability</li><li>Only for Pro models</li></ul><h2 id="Nomad-Modern-Leather-Case"><a href="#Nomad-Modern-Leather-Case" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Modern Leather Case"></a>Nomad Modern Leather Case</h2><h3 id="Best-leather-case-for-iPhone-16"><a href="#Best-leather-case-for-iPhone-16" class="headerlink" title="Best leather case for iPhone 16"></a>Best leather case for iPhone 16</h3><p>Leather is always a stylish and sleek choice for a phone case. However, it is not always the best at lasting or, sometimes, gripping your phone. That is why the Nomad Modern Leather case is a standout in this category. Even though leather is not the most sustainable material, Nomad asserts it sources it in sustainable ways.</p><p>ZDNET’s Hiner places the Nomad Leather case on his list of the best cases for iPhone 15 Pro. He writes, “With Apple’s leather cases, it would take weeks or months to absorb hand oils and become softer and easier to grip… With Nomad’s leather, you don’t have to do that. It’s soft and feels great in your hands as soon as you take it out of the box. If leather is still your thing, it’s a better leather case than the ones Apple used to sell.”</p><p>That being said, leather is not everybody’s thing. But, if you are in the market for a leather case with a MagSafe back, possibly sustainably sourced material, a camera protection, the Nomad Modern Leather case may be your winner.</p><p><strong>Nomad Modern Leather case features:</strong> 8 feet drop protection | Sustainably sourced leather | MagSafe and magnetic back</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-iPhone-16-case"><a href="#What-is-the-best-iPhone-16-case" class="headerlink" title="What is the best iPhone 16 case?"></a>What is the best iPhone 16 case?</h2><p>Our pick for the best iPhone 16 case is the Nomad Sport case for its sleek design and solid protection.

The most relevant aspects are:</p><ul><li><strong>Drop</strong> <strong>Protection:</strong> The hard truth is that all humans are accident-prone. If you are anything like me, dropping your phone is more than a daily occurrence. When picking a phone case, it is wise to consider how often you drop your phone.</li><li><strong>Style:</strong> iPhone cases go beyond just protecting the device. Like most people, you may want a phone case that matches your personal style and is pleasing to the eye.</li><li><strong>Cost:</strong> iPhones are expensive, and spending a lot on a phone case just adds to the bill. Therefore, we consider price an important factor in our selections.</li><li><strong>Special Features:</strong> Many cases have added features like MagSafe capabilities and a kickstand. We include these products to appease those who may prefer wireless charging or other necessary features.</li></ul><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-iPhone-16-cases"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-iPhone-16-cases" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these iPhone 16 cases?"></a>How did we choose these iPhone 16 cases?</h2><p>To choose these iPhone 16 cases, we performed extensive research over every corner of the internet, like Reddit forums and customer reviews, to find the best picks at the time of this writing.

The new version of Bing has certainly shaken up the industry—although it hasn’t been without controversy.</p><p> The service frequently hits the headlines thanks to its willingness to churn out incorrect information with complete confidence (and get surprisingly argumentative about it). Microsoft also acknowledges that the performance might be limited in these early days due to bandwidth issues.</p><p> And in its mobile form, it is still very much a search tool, so is not something that’s going to be replacing Google Assistant, Siri, Bixby, or any other voice assistant any time soon.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-crafting-the-perfect-tiktok-image-with-simple-hacks-for-2024/"><u>[New] Crafting the Perfect TikTok Image with Simple Hacks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-speedy-snapshot-and-voice-guided-session-creator/"><u>[New] In 2024, Speedy Snapshot & Voice-Guided Session Creator</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-nikon-j5-sets-new-standards-in-4k-video-capture/"><u>[New] Nikon J5 Sets New Standards in 4K Video Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-bandicam-demystified-a-clearer-understanding-of-2023-functionality/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Bandicam Demystified A Clearer Understanding of 2023 Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/approved-the-self-sustained-youtube-moguls-handbook-no-ads-only-gains/"><u>2024 Approved The Self-Sustained YouTube Mogul’s Handbook No Ads, Only Gains</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-openais-shapley-explainer-shape-features-and-uses/"><u>A Comprehensive Guide to OpenAI's Shapley Explainer (ShapE): Features & Uses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/1722016610906-access-chatgpt-anywhere-with-the-new-android-app/"><u>Access ChatGPT Anywhere with the New Android App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/adaptive-technology-start-with-your-8-customized-models-now/"><u>Adaptive Technology: Start with Your 8 Customized Models Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/ai-assistant-faceoff-which-reigns-supreme-chatgpt-or-hugbingchat/"><u>AI Assistant Faceoff: Which Reigns Supreme, ChatGPT or HugbingChat?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/ai-leap-from-gpt-35-to-gpt-4-discovering-the-five-essential-differences-explored/"><u>AI Leap From GPT-3.5 to GPT-4: Discovering the Five Essential Differences Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/1722106342965-exploring-the-viability-of-using-chatgpt-to-enhance-your-writing-through-proofreading-assistance/"><u>Exploring the Viability of Using ChatGPT to Enhance Your Writing Through Proofreading Assistance.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-workspace.techidaily.com/fixing-previous-versions-access-issues-in-windows-11-update-recovery/"><u>Fixing 'Previous Versions' Access Issues in Windows 11 Update Recovery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-bypass-vivo-y100a-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>Full Guide to Bypass Vivo Y100A FRP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-from-vivo-s18e-devices-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass Google FRP Lock from Vivo S18e Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/1722184338031-no-subscriptions-for-gpt-4-however-select-plus-membership-retains-its-unique-6-features/"><u>No Subscriptions for GPT-4: However, Select Plus Membership Retains Its Unique 6 Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/tips-and-solutions-for-diablo-2-resurrected-game-stop-issues/"><u>Tips and Solutions for Diablo 2 Resurrected Game-Stop Issues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/vanguard-headgear-companies-for-vr-for-2024/"><u>Vanguard Headgear Companies for VR for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/1722201689537-waiting-for-chatgpts-desktop-version-is-tough-heres-a-great-free-software-replacement/"><u>Waiting for ChatGPT's Desktop Version Is Tough – Here’s a Great, Free Software Replacement!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/1721926571623-what-is-behind-elon-musks-bold-claims-exploring-the-revolutionary-concept-of-truthgpt/"><u>What Is Behind Elon Musk's Bold Claims?

As expected, Apple today announced a series of updates to VisionOS. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/live-updates-everything-apple-announced-at-wwdc-2024-including-ios-18-siri-ai-more/" >Everything Apple announced at WWDC 2024, including iOS 18, Siri, AI, and more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Did they improve the overall quality of life and usability of Apple’s most quixotic moonshot? I’ll tell you this: Apple only addressed two of the ten items I asked for. On the other hand, Apple did announce a bunch of additional features. I’ll discuss them here in the order Apple presented them during the keynote.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Turn-2D-images-into-spatial-photos"><a href="#1-Turn-2D-images-into-spatial-photos" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn 2D images into spatial photos"></a>1. Turn 2D images into spatial photos</h2><p>I’ve never been terribly impressed by Apple’s implementation of spatial photos, which are photos that have a 3D feel to them. The little square box and the fairly minimal lens separation of the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> resulted in something that seems more novelty than noteworthy. </p><p>Now, Apple has announced that it’s using machine learning to derive a left eye and right eye’s view of all your 2D photos, allowing you to view your flat photos as if they were 3D images. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-get-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/" >Every iPhone model that will get Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones won’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Now, here’s the thing. I tried watching a couple of Marvel 3D movies via Disney+ on the Vision Pro. All the Marvel movies were filmed in 2D and digitally remastered into 3D movies. The 3D effect is pretty underwhelming. Sometimes an object seems to be pulled from the background, but otherwise, it’s not much to write home about. </p><p>I’m guessing that Apple’s 3Difying of a 2D image will be at about the same level. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/umvX4ZdWbxk?si=tPXL0-Kzf9SQaY8z" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Watch-those-images-together-using-SharePlay-in-the-Photos-app"><a href="#2-Watch-those-images-together-using-SharePlay-in-the-Photos-app" class="headerlink" title="2. Watch those images together using SharePlay in the Photos app"></a>2. Watch those images together using SharePlay in the Photos app</h2><p>And here’s another feature that I can’t imagine any users clamoring for. Now, if you have multiple Vision Pro users, they can all see and discuss the same image together while using the Photos app. </p><p>So, yeah, if Grandma Sadie in Seattle has a Vision Pro, Cousin Marty in Miami has a Vision Pro, and you have a Vision Pro in Yuma, you can all stand around the virtual photo screen and ooh and ah over pictures of baby Alice. </p><h2 id="3-Gestures-for-opening-Home-View-and-Control-Center"><a href="#3-Gestures-for-opening-Home-View-and-Control-Center" class="headerlink" title="3. Gestures for opening Home View and Control Center"></a>3. Gestures for opening Home View and Control Center</h2><p>While it’s easy enough to open Vision Pro’s home view (the field of app icons) by pressing the Digital Crown on the top of the unit, getting to Control Center is a pain. VisionOS puts a tiny little arrow waaay up at the top of the viewing space, and you have to glance at it and tap your fingers together to get it to open. </p><p>In VisionOS 2, there are gestures. Holding your hand palm up and tapping fingers opens the app view. Flipping your hand over will give you time and battery level. A finger tap in this position will open up Control Center. </p><p>Unlike the previous two features, this <em>is</em> a quality of life improvement. </p><h2 id="4-Mac-virtual-display-improvements"><a href="#4-Mac-virtual-display-improvements" class="headerlink" title="4. Mac virtual display improvements"></a>4. Mac virtual display improvements</h2><p>The Mac virtual display feature of the Vision Pro has been nice, but limited. In VisionOS 1, you could only show one 4K display. Personally, I’m waiting for Apple to ditch the entire display paradigm and just show windows, but that’s not going to happen this year. </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>On the other hand, Apple “later this year” will enable you to create displays with more resolutions. The most interesting is the full wrap-around display, which will be the equivalent of two 4K monitors. </p><h2 id="5-Choo-choo-train-mode"><a href="#5-Choo-choo-train-mode" class="headerlink" title="5. Choo-choo train mode"></a>5. Choo-choo train mode</h2><p>To be fair, Apple didn’t call it that. We’ve <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/itching-to-try-vision-pros-travel-mode-heres-what-to-expect-before-you-go/" >talked about the Vision Pro’s travel mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was mostly intended for airplane travel. </p><p>In VisionOS 2, Apple is announcing that there is dedicated support in travel mode for train travel. We know <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8ckKAjAWLw8" >people have already been successful using the Vision Pro on the train and even subway <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but in this case, Apple presumably tweaked performance somewhat. </p><h2 id="6-New-developer-APIs"><a href="#6-New-developer-APIs" class="headerlink" title="6. New developer APIs"></a>6. New developer APIs</h2><p>There are a ton of VR and AR APIs in Apple’s platforms. But this week, at WWDC, Apple is showcasing three new APIs developers can use to gain access to Apple technology. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-visionos-18-things-developers-need-to-know-about-coding-for-apple-vision-pro/" >Inside VisionOS: 18 things developers need to know about coding for Apple Vision Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Volumetric API:</strong> Allows complex 3D apps to run side-by-side. A volumetric API is at the core of most 3D content, because it allows developers to create, manage, and present volumetric content. My read on this announcement is not the introduction of a Volumetric API, but that it can allow multiple 3D apps to run concurrently.</li><li><strong>TabletopKit:</strong> Helps developers create apps that anchor to flat surfaces. One obvious example is board game kits, but this could apply to interior design apps, architectural and construction projects, gaming, navigation, and more.</li><li><strong>Enterprise APIs:</strong> These were described as enterprise-specific APIs, so we can assume they’re somewhat special purpose. Examples given were surgical training and manufacturing.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0Ww1YIIUe4?si=cQ-Gkh9UCJABuPZU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-New-Canon-spatial-lens-for-creating-spatial-video"><a href="#7-New-Canon-spatial-lens-for-creating-spatial-video" class="headerlink" title="7.

Apple announced today that Canon will be introducing a spatial lens for its <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Canon-RF-S18-150mm-Mirrorless-Processor-Detection/dp/B0B2KSD7WW/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cbfbe271d-4f99-40f4-b81e-3b3c556a641c%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >EOS R7 digital camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>This allows more commercial and prosumer projects where the photographer or videographer needs more control over the complex range of settings available in a more traditional camera. Those videos can then be edited in Final Cut Pro, Apple’s only mention of Final Cut during WWDC. There’s also a new Vimeo app for VisionOS, that will allow spatial videos to be shared. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nlwr9LjJ-ng?si=I6UNAtfBkY2FTceu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Third-party-immersive-video-workflow"><a href="#8-Third-party-immersive-video-workflow" class="headerlink" title="8. Third-party immersive video workflow"></a>8. Third-party immersive video workflow</h2><p>One of the truly breathtaking experiences of the Vision Pro is what Apple calls Immersive video. This is a very big step beyond the typical 3D video we’ve seen in movies and TV shows. The entire experience wraps around you 180 degrees. When it’s done right, it’s astonishing. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-watched-apples-newest-immersive-video-on-the-vision-pro-and-it-was-my-aha-moment/" >I watched Apple’s newest Immersive Video on the Vision Pro, and it was my ‘aha’ moment <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple is opening up the format for third-party creators to create immersive video. The approach is to use cameras and DaVinci Resolve Studio from <a class="link"   href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/" >Blackmagic Design <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. There’s no doubt that Blackmagic makes excellent gear and that DaVinci Resolve is a fine application. It’s just a little surprising that Apple didn’t bake this capability into its own high-end video production tool, Final Cut Pro.</p><p>Even so, I think this is great. Those immersive videos are fantastic. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iPCr_bxZjMQ?si=ubOsoq5umPEXL9xL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Other-new-features"><a href="#Other-new-features" class="headerlink" title="Other new features"></a>Other new features</h2><p>Apple didn’t cover all the new features during its announcement. At the end of the Vision Pro segment, the company put up one of its feature grid graphics (shown at the beginning of this article). Here are a few that weren’t mentioned: </p><ul><li><strong>Mouse support:</strong> I mentioned this in my wishlist. Apple’s presenters didn’t mention it, but it’s on that grid of features. Hurray!</li><li><strong>Keyboard breakthrough:</strong> This was another feature I felt it was important for Apple to introduce, and apparently it will be available. No mention was made of it, so we have no idea if it’s limited solely to Apple’s own keyboards (but that’s probably the case).</li><li><strong>Bora Bora environment:</strong> I wanted to see more environments and we get…one. Personally, I think all the work on spatial photos and spatial videos could have been replaced with the ability for third parties to create 3D environments, but Apple didn’t go there. But hey, Bora Bora, right?</li><li><strong>Rearrangeable Home View:</strong> This was also not described but I’m guessing this means you can move around the Home icons.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHPljBHrvkA?si=HwdfDM9rlbABSIrx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-do-you-think"><a href="#What-do-you-think" class="headerlink" title="What do you think?"></a>What do you think?</h2><p>I’ll admit, I’m fairly underwhelmed. I definitely would have thought there would be a bunch of new environments (at least one or two indoors), as well as third-party options. </p><p>Apple did announce that more than 2,000 apps were built specifically for the Vision Pro and more than 1.5 million iPad apps are compatible. But I’m still surprised that Apple didn’t create spatial versions of its remaining non-spatial apps (i.e., Books, Calendar, Clock, Home, Maps, Podcasts, Reminders, Shortcuts, Stocks, and Voice Memos). </p><p>And, I’m shocked that Find My support is still missing from VisionOS (or at least wasn’t mentioned). </p><p>What do you think? Is VisionOS 2 enough to get us through another year of this astoundingly expensive device? Is there anything in VisionOS 2 that wasn’t in VisionOS 1 that would inspire you now to go out and buy one? If you have a Vision Pro, will any of these features improve your quality of life? Let us know in the comments below. </p><hr><p><em>You can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

After an extended hiatus in product releases, Beats dropped news of the upcoming Solo Buds today, alongside its new headphones, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-beats-new-solo-4-headphones-and-these-3-features-stand-out-the-most/" >Beats Solo 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which ZDNET’s Jada Jones recently had the chance to review.   </p><p>The ultralight earbuds come in four colors: Matte Black, Storm Gray, Arctic Purple, and Transparent Red, the last of which screams Beats’ iconic style. In addition, they’re going for $79.99, putting them at a very competitive entry-level price point.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-cheap-earbuds/"><strong>The best budget earbuds under $100: Expert tested</strong></a></p><p>So what do you get for a pair of <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-cheap-earbuds/" >earbuds that cost less than $100 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? The 217-gram Solo Buds claim to offer big sound in a tiny package, with dual-layer transducers in each earbud, one-touch Bluetooth pairing with both iOS and Android-powered smartphones, and customizable press-and-hold functions on the earbuds themselves.</p><p>Note, however, that the Solo Buds do not feature active noise cancellation technology, although Beats claims the earbuds’ acoustic design facilitates noise reduction on their own.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>In addition, the case – which is 100% fiber-based from recycled materials – does not actually charge the earbuds; you’ll need to plug in the USB-C charger to a power source. However, with a reported 18 hours of battery life, charging sessions should be manageable. The fast charging feature reportedly juices up the earbuds with five hours of playback from a 10-minute charge. </p><p>At less than $100, the Beats Solo Buds will join an increasingly competitive price point with other earbuds that are considered “budget” but include features seen in more expensive devices, such as the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/youre-overpaying-for-noise-canceling-earbuds-and-this-60-pair-proves-it/" >JLabs JBuds ANC 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which <em>do</em> feature active noise cancellation, and run $60. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/beats-studio-pro-review/"><strong>Beats Studio Pro: So close to being my dream headphones</strong></a></p><p>If you want to get your hands on the new Solo Buds, you’ll have to wait a bit, as they won’t be shipping until after the Solo 4 headphones do, in June 2024. Apple owns the Beats line of headphones, so their release early this summer was likely planned to drop well before their flagship line of earbuds. With <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-new-airpods-models-expected-this-fall-heres-everything-we-know-so-far/" >two new models of AirPods expected to be unveiled this fall <i

You can explore the app, ask a few questions, and see how it works without signing up. However, if you see yourself using the app after your test, we’d recommend you sign up. That way, you can preserve your search history so you can always refer to it.</p><p> You can use Perplexity for a wide range of purposes, including research, professional development, and content creation. Perplexity AI is also perfect for answering those random questions that pop into your head, from “How to make a homemade kite?” and “Why do we stuff pillows with feathers?” to much more complex queries. It provides quick, reliable answers that satisfy your curiosity.</p><p> Perplexity is free to use. However, you can upgrade to its Pro plan ($20&#x2F;month) for access to additional features, such as unlimited access to its more powerful AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus and Sonnet, and Mistral’s Large, plus support for images and files, and better support.</p><h2 id="Can-Perplexity-AI-Replace-Google"><a href="#Can-Perplexity-AI-Replace-Google" class="headerlink" title="Can Perplexity AI Replace Google?"></a>Can Perplexity AI Replace Google?</h2><p> While Perplexity AI offers a unique value proposition, it’s not positioned to replace Google entirely. Google’s vast data infrastructure and established user base give it an advantage in many areas. Perplexity excels in providing AI overviews of user queries. However, it’s not effective for several other uses that Google has come to be known for, like weather forecasts and geo-sensitive queries.</p><p> For example, a search for “bakery near me” returned a “summary” of a list of bakeries. The interesting part? Not one from its list was within a 100-mile radius. The same query on Google returned options within a five-mile radius, which is absolutely what I wanted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-showing-search-result-on-perplexity.jpg"                      alt="screenshot showing search result on perplexity"                ></p><p> It’s worth noting that<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-access-google-ai-powered-search/" >Google has been testing Search Generative Experience (SGE) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , an AI-assisted search feature. SGE provides AI overviews of search queries similar to Perplexity AI. Perplexity AI currently does a better job of answering queries thoroughly and also provides in-text citations for cross-referencing. However, this is something Google can replicate, if it becomes where the battle line is drawn.</p><p> Perplexity AI is reportedly working on bringing ads to its platform, per<a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/1/24118154/perplexity-will-try-a-form-of-ads-on-its-ai-search-platform" >The Verge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . How it executes its ad features will determine much of the platform’s future. Perplexity has a lot to prove (and improve!) to really stand up to Google.</p><p> Perplexity AI’s journey is one to watch, as it has the potential to carve out a significant niche in the search engine market. Its success will largely depend on how it integrates additional capabilities and responds to user feedback. Whether it will ever stand toe-to-toe with Google remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Perplexity AI is a tool worth watching and, more importantly, using.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-the-standard-unique-augmented-reality-stickers/"><u>[Updated] Beyond the Standard Unique Augmented Reality Stickers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-step-by-step-for-beginner-3d-lut-masters/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Step-by-Step for Beginner 3D LUT Masters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unveiling-the-purpose-of-watermarks-in-fb-media/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unveiling the Purpose of Watermarks in Fb Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-how-to-make-a-thumbnail-for-your-youtube-free-easily/"><u>2024 Approved How to Make a Thumbnail for Your YouTube Free Easily!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/delivering-power-on-a-penny-zte-blade-a3y-smashes-expectations-in-budget-device-showdown/"><u>Delivering Power on a Penny: ZTE Blade A3Y Smashes Expectations in Budget Device Showdown</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-to-access-boot-options-menu-in-windows-11-solved/"><u>How to Access Boot Options Menu in Windows 11 [Solved]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-to-deactivate-microsofts-guard-in-windows-11-with-3-different-approaches/"><u>How to Deactivate Microsoft's Guard in Windows 11 with 3 Different Approaches</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-to-empty-your-browsers-memory-a-guide-to-clearing-mozilla-firefoxs-cache/"><u>How To Empty Your Browser's Memory: A Guide to Clearing Mozilla Firefox's Cache</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-to-fresh-start-your-pc-with-a-windows-10-reset-learn-the-simplest-method-in-4-key-steps/"><u>How to Fresh Start Your PC with a Windows 10 Reset - Learn the Simplest Method in 4 Key Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-to-overclock-your-gpu-a-beginners-guide/"><u>How to Overclock Your GPU: A Beginner’s Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-to-seamlessly-connect-office-pcs-to-the-local-wi-fi-network-a-comprehensive-tutorial/"><u>How To Seamlessly Connect Office PCs to the Local Wi-Fi Network - A Comprehensive Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/is-max-360-superior-to-hero-11-in-video-quality-in-2024/"><u>Is Max 360 Superior to Hero 11 in Video Quality, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/leap-into-productivity-windows-11s-multiple-folder-creation-tricks/"><u>Leap Into Productivity: Windows 11'S Multiple Folder Creation Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/leveraging-auto-gtp-in-everyday-tasks/"><u>Leveraging Auto-GTP in Everyday Tasks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/maximizing-your-bluetooth-connectivity-enhancing-signal-strength-and-range-in-windows-10-and-11/"><u>Maximizing Your Bluetooth Connectivity: Enhancing Signal Strength and Range in Windows 10 & 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/k-youtube-star-status-becoming-a-self-assured-vlogger/"><u>Unlock YouTube Star Status Becoming a Self-Assured Vlogger</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

And since it’s integrated into your programming environment, it’s more quickly available than a web app like ChatGPT. This saves you time and concentration, especially over long coding sessions.</p><p> To make a request, simply highlight your code, click on the “twinkle&#x2F;star” icon, and provide your instructions:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/using-requests-in-github-copilot.jpg"                      alt="Easy code refactoring with GitHub Copilot"                ></p><p> Your subscription to GitHub Copilot also comes bundled with GitHub Copilot Chat. You can use it to ask coding questions, debug your program, and generate new lines of code. GitHub Copilot Chat generates usable code that will be a good fit for your project:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generate-code-with-github-copilot.jpg"                      alt="Customized code generation with GitHub Copilot"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qbuund2HKOQ?si=NaGHqIrx8hSL7gWV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If your primary focus is on programming, and you’re looking for a tool to help you with writing, debugging, and refactoring code, GitHub Copilot is the clear choice. Its ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant code snippets can significantly speed up development workflows and reduce coding errors.</p><p> Furthermore, its integration with popular IDEs, multi-language support, and collaborative coding system ensures GitHub Copilot works well on any team-based project. Whether you’re programming for a passion project or a team player in a large company, GitHub Copilot provides advanced AI capabilities that make coding fast and easy.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-Is-Better-for-Learning"><a href="#ChatGPT-Is-Better-for-Learning" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Is Better for Learning"></a>ChatGPT Is Better for Learning</h2><p> While ChatGPT may not match GitHub Copilot’s prowess in code completion, it excels in other aspects outside of programming.

Its ability to generate human-like responses makes it an ideal learning tool that any programmer can use. Whether it’s a complex algorithm or a programming principle you’re trying to grasp, ChatGPT can break it down into understandable parts.</p><p> What’s great about ChatGPT is that it offers a completely free version that you can use throughout your learning process. Of course, a paid subscription does have extra benefits like better response quality and plugins. But overall, as long as you<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-get-best-results-from-chatgpt/" >employ prompting techniques <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the free version should work fine as a learning tool.</p><h2 id="You-Can-Always-Use-Both"><a href="#You-Can-Always-Use-Both" class="headerlink" title="You Can Always Use Both"></a>You Can Always Use Both</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/using-chatgpt-and-github-copilot.jpg"                      alt="Using both ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQbNyknjJJ8?si=RGVIEWLdPbvRC_r6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Why choose between GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT when you can use both to your benefit? Integrating these tools into your workflow can offer the best of both worlds.</p><p> Use GitHub Copilot for code completion and ChatGPT to understand concepts and reinforce learning. Both together should provide enough help for you to program a well-thought-out project you’ll be happy to show off.</p><p> If you’re a student, you can benefit from free access to GitHub Copilot. Combine that with OpenAI’s already free ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo, and you’ll have both tools without paying a cent!</p><p> A monthly GitHub Copilot subscription and the freely available ChatGPT-3.5 should provide enough assistance for both personal and professional projects.

For code completion and generation, tools like TabNine and Codeium offer similar functionality to GitHub Copilot.</p><p> Aside from Claude AI, there are no really good alternatives to ChatGPT unless you want to spend time setting up a local chatbot. In that case, you may be interested in chatbots like GPT4All, Nvidia Chat with RTX, and the various BERT models using TextGen WebUI.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-creating-accessible-multilingual-content-on-igtv/"><u>[New] In 2024, Creating Accessible Multilingual Content on IGTV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-whatsapp-sound-hacks-incorporating-melodies/"><u>[New] WhatsApp Sound Hacks Incorporating Melodies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-tiktok-videos-editing-hacks-revealed/"><u>[Updated] Mastering TikTok Videos Editing Hacks Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-navigate-the-best-free-photography-enhancers-worldwide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Navigate the Best Free Photography Enhancers Worldwide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/10-best-cost-free-subtitle-grabs-from-youtube/"><u>10 Best Cost-Free Subtitle Grabs From YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-elevate-to-a-custom-hashtag-mastery-on-tiktok/"><u>2024 Approved Elevate to a Custom Hashtag Mastery on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/chatgpts-evolution-interactive-dialogue-unleashed/"><u>ChatGPT's Evolution: Interactive Dialogue Unleashed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/comparative-analysis-distinctive-features-of-chatgpt-and-microsoft-bings-ai/"><u>Comparative Analysis: Distinctive Features of ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing's AI</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/mastering-chatbot-management-leveraging-folders-in-chatgpt-sessions/"><u>Mastering Chatbot Management: Leveraging Folders in ChatGPT Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/stay-ahead-of-threats-with-our-comprehensive-guide-to-7-key-cyber-predictions/"><u>Stay Ahead of Threats with Our Comprehensive Guide to 7 Key Cyber Predictions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/the-combined-legal-wave-by-artists-against-ai-giants/"><u>The Combined Legal Wave by Artists Against AI Giants</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/top-10-airplay-apps-in-tecno-spark-go-2023-for-streaming-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 10 AirPlay Apps in Tecno Spark Go (2023) for Streaming | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/trouble-using-chatgpt-uncover-its-current-status-with-these-cufficient-methods/"><u>Trouble Using ChatGPT?

Sometimes, it doesn’t get any of it. </p><p>It reacts when you haven’t asked it anything. It also hears things that you simply haven’t said. And its answers can range from the unhelpful to the downright bewildering, especially, if – like me – you have something of an accent.</p><p>Worst of all, the brand name “Siri” has become something of a joke.

Because of Google’s dominance, Bing felt like a struggling search engine in search of a retirement home. It seemed clear that a trite name with a less-than-competitive product wasn’t an ideal mix. </p><p>Microsoft, on the other hand, is a strong brand – one that’s become both more important and more likable in recent years. Add the notion of a Copilot to it and it suddenly feels like something with which you want to be involved, something that has a chance to be your true companion, something that might <em>actually</em> be good.</p><p>Meanwhile, Siri connotes the phrase “You cannot be Sirious.” </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XS1nQCe95LU?si=A2dhdFkSAI61_nKA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Hey-Siri-say-goodbye"><a href="#Hey-Siri-say-goodbye" class="headerlink" title="Hey Siri, say goodbye"></a>Hey Siri, say goodbye</h2><p>Siri enjoys a Reddit thread <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/16gijak/siri%5Fis%5Fpathetic%5Fhow%5Fis%5Fthis%5Fallowed%5Fto%5Fhappen/" >entitled <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>: “Siri is pathetic.

Just like iPhones and cases, Apple Watches can be upgraded and customized for many situations, from casual to dressy, thanks to their interchangeable watch bands. </p><p>I’ve been an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> user for a few years now, and I recently upgraded from a Series 3 watch to the latest <a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-SE-2nd-Gen-GPS-40mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-Sport-Band-S-M-Fitness-Sleep-Tracker-Crash-Detection-Heart-Rate-Monitor/5033741510?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Watch SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Over the last several months, I’ve embarked on a journey to test Apple Watch bands from brands like Apple, Nomad, Spigen, and more, to find the best watch bands made of materials ranging from stainless steel to fabric to leather. I’ve also included input from other ZDNET experts who frequently try different watch bands and switch up their looks and consulted staff and customer reviews for bands across the market. Every pick on this list is backed by hands-on testing  staff. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/"><strong>The best Apple Watches you can buy</strong></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gkdZ3A1mock?si=2zeR5GtTU2VujM_w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What’s-the-best-Apple-Watch-band-right-now"><a href="#What’s-the-best-Apple-Watch-band-right-now" class="headerlink" title="What’s the best Apple Watch band right now?"></a>What’s the best Apple Watch band right now?</h2><p>After months of wearing different bands during my daily activities and considering the rest of the ZDNET staff’s extensive hands-on analysis of watch bands, my pick for the best Apple Watch band overall is <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-band-black" >Nomad’s Sport Band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> thanks to its comfortable and breathable wear and its numerous color choices, including limited edition drops, for a nice upgrade over the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWMR3AM/A/41mm-soft-mint-sport-band-s-m?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >plain sports band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that came with my Apple Watch.</p><p>Not looking for a sport band pick?

It is designed for intense workouts and everyday wear. Plus, it’s 100% waterproof, so you can wear it as you exercise in rain, sleet, or snow without worrying about damage. Its lightweight design that encourages ventilation has also solved my sweaty gym wrists (if you know, you know). </p><p>If you’re looking to purchase a sport band or you love Nomad’s bands, we recommend keeping an eye on their website because the company regularly offers Limited Edition models with cool colors and styles (including the one pictured above on my Apple Watch SE). These historically sell out quickly, so if you see a limited edition offering, it’s smart to make your purchase quickly.</p><p>I tested the Nomad Sport band in the limited edition glow-in-the-dark Glow 2.0 design, and I was impressed with how similar it felt and performed to my original Apple sport band. Although not every sport band features this fun glow, they all offer the same features. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nomads-glow-in-the-dark-iphone-case-just-sold-out-but-its-alternatives-are-just-as-good/"><strong>Nomad’s glow-in-the-dark iPhone case just sold out, but its alternatives are just as good</strong></a></p><p>When I tested the Nomad sport band, I liked the durable yet comfortable material, the numerous color options available, the customizable adjustability, and the overall look of the band. Getting the band initially secured was a little difficult, but over time, I got it on and off quickly. It’s a nice upgrade from the standard Apple band, and should work for most people. Since it offers more notch options, it felt more secure on my wrist than the Apple sport band, and I felt it stayed cleaner than my Apple band typically does. </p><p>I only have two issues with this band. The first is that after a few weeks of wear, the coating on the stainless steel pin started coming off, although it isn’t noticeable unless I look very closely. Secondly, despite the numerous color options, I wish Nomad offered more, like some softer pastels.</p><p>Nomad sport band customers on <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16ldce5/are%5Fnomad%5Fstraps%5Fany%5Fgood/" >Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> said they liked the quality, color options (including limited edition designs), and overall value of the band. Some customers said the band did not sit flush with the Apple Watch Ultra, and one customer said the stainless steel pin broke off their band (although they reported customer service promptly replaced their purchase). </p><p><strong>Nomad Sport Band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Fluoroelastomer rubber | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch Ultra, Series 9, 8, 7, 6, SE, and all previous versions of Apple Watch | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 45mm&#x2F;49mm or 40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://burga.sjv.io/c/159047/1270603/15631?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%253A%252F%252Fus.burga.com%252Fproducts%252Fall-eyes-on-me-apple-watch-band&subId1=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp" >View now at Burga <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Two-tone design</li><li>Similar feel to jewelry watch</li><li>Clasp closure</li><li>Affordable luxury</li><li>Adjustable</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Clasp can sometimes clip skin</li><li>Requires careful wear&#x2F;proper care</li></ul><h2 id="Burga-Stainless-Steel-Two-Tone-Apple-Watch-Band"><a href="#Burga-Stainless-Steel-Two-Tone-Apple-Watch-Band" class="headerlink" title="Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch Band"></a>Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch Band</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHafwnWSEQk?si=rejNVNpJZH2SqNLy" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-metal-Apple-Watch-band-for-style"><a href="#Best-metal-Apple-Watch-band-for-style" class="headerlink" title="Best metal Apple Watch band for style"></a>Best metal Apple Watch band for style</h3><p>Since I began exploring Apple watch bands, I’ve been searching for one that I can use to dress up my everyday look. This Burga watch band offers a two-tone stainless steel strap and an easy clasp closure. The inside is designed for comfort, and the band can support everyday wear and tear.</p><p>When I tested this Burga watch over a few weeks, I was immediately impressed with its overall appearance. It looked expensive and of quality, echoing the same look as a non-smart watch. It has a nice weight, and it was easy to follow the adjustment instructions to fit it to my wrist. </p><p>Throughout testing, I received several compliments on this band – which doesn’t often happen despite the number of products I test through my work, and I was happy with the affordable luxury look it gave my Watch SE. I had no issues with tarnishing or chipping after my few weeks of wear, although I was careful around water, did not wear the band while applying lotion, makeup, or perfume, and used a jewelry cloth to wipe it down every few wears or so. I also did not wear this band during intense workouts, but it was fine during my casual walks, usually 3-5 miles daily. </p><p>With proper care, this watch band offers great value. It looks much more expensive than it is, and it is worth the money if you’re looking to switch up your look for a special occasion or a few times a week. It is slightly pricier than bands made of less expensive materials but significantly less expensive than titanium options. </p><p>Current Burga customers said they liked this watch band’s overall design and quality, with some saying it looks and feels like an affordable luxury. </p><p><strong>Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Stainless steel | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> No | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> All current Apple Watch models | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 42mm&#x2F;44mm&#x2F;45mm&#x2F;49mm or 38mm&#x2F;40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-slim-band-white-41mm" >View now at Nomad Goods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Durable</li><li>High quality</li><li>Interior ventilation</li><li>Slim profile</li><li>Good for small wrists</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Limited color options</li><li>Slight wear on stainless steel pin</li><li>A little pricey</li></ul><h2 id="Nomad-Slim-Sport-Band"><a href="#Nomad-Slim-Sport-Band" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Slim Sport Band"></a>Nomad Slim Sport Band</h2><h3 id="Best-slim-everyday-Apple-Watch-band"><a href="#Best-slim-everyday-Apple-Watch-band" class="headerlink" title="Best slim everyday Apple Watch band"></a>Best slim everyday Apple Watch band</h3><p>Nomad’s slim sport band is a thinner version of the brand’s sport band. Though it features a similar design, material, and overall feel, the slim band has a thinner construction and a smaller overall look on the wearer’s wrist. </p><p>Like the classic sport band, the slim band is 100% waterproof, features a lightweight design that encourages ventilation, and is made of the same durable material. I was able to test the slim sport band for several weeks with my Apple Watch SE in starlight, and I liked how similar in color and feel it was to the Apple-issue sport band that came with my watch. </p><p>When I tested the band, I was also impressed with how secure the stainless steel pin kept the watch despite its more delicate profile. I prefer the slim band over Nomad’s classic sport band for everyday wear, though I can understand why this style may not be the best for someone with larger wrists or a desire for a more prominent watch band. </p><p>Like the sport band, it was a little tough to put on at first, but it became easier to do so the more I wore it. I have also seen some chipping on the stainless steel pin’s coating, and like with the sport band, I wish there were more color options. Since the slim band is my preferred style, it’s a bit of a disappointment that there are only four color options, especially when the larger sport band has quite a bit more and limited edition offerings. I’d love to see more punchy colors and some soft pastels in the slim band – it’s a great option for often smaller women’s wrists. </p><p>Regardless of my feelings about the color selection, I enjoyed testing the slim band, and since then, I’ve been frequently wearing it in my daily activities. </p><p><strong>Nomad Slim Sport Band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Fluoroelastomer rubber | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch Ultra, Series 9, 8, 7, 6, SE, and all previous versions of Apple Watch <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 45mm&#x2F;49mm or 40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.spigen.com/products/apple-watch-series-band-liquid-crystal-pro" >View now at Spigen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Crytal-Designed-Crystal/dp/B098SX92FT?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cf4142531-1ed4-4f98-8c0a-beb247fccf63%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Truly clear</li><li>Case and band combo</li><li>Easy to take on and off</li><li>Easy to insert watch</li><li>Affordable</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Needs breaking in</li><li>Silicone not the most malleable</li></ul><h2 id="Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Pro-Apple-Watch-Case-and-Band"><a href="#Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Pro-Apple-Watch-Case-and-Band" class="headerlink" title="Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch Case and Band"></a>Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch Case and Band</h2><h3 id="Best-clear-Apple-Watch-case-and-band"><a href="#Best-clear-Apple-Watch-case-and-band" class="headerlink" title="Best clear Apple Watch case and band"></a>Best clear Apple Watch case and band</h3><p>Spigen’s Liquid Proband is both an Apple watch strap and a case in one. Simply pop in your Apple Watch and fasten it to your wrist – you don’t have to deal with sliding any bands in. The Liquid Pro is available in crystal clear and black space clear colors. </p><p>It is made of soft silicone for comfort, fastens with a traditional buckle, and features a unibody design. I wasn’t expecting to like this band and case combo as much as I did. While I don’t think I’d consider this for myself for everyday wear, this is a great option for kids thanks to its all-in-one approach or for those looking to minimize the appearance of their watch thanks to the crystal clear design. </p><p>When I tested this watch band over a few months, I liked how easy it was to pop my watch in and out of this case yet how secure it remained. I also liked that the built-in case provided extra protection around my watch. The watch band itself is pretty comfortable overall, though the silicone wasn’t extremely malleable and is still a bit stiff. I predict that over more daily wear, it will eventually contour more to one’s wrist, but it definitely needs breaking in. </p><p><strong>Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Silicone | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 40mm&#x2F;44mm&#x2F;45mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://www.nike.com/w/apple-watch-nike-sport-band-7dq6d" >View now at Nike <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUV53AM/A/45mm-midnight-sky-nike-sport-band-m-l&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Comfortable</li><li>Breathes well</li><li>Durable</li><li>Fun colors</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Dust and residue collect in the holes</li><li>Requires cleaning</li></ul><h2 id="Nike-Apple-Watch-Sport-Band"><a href="#Nike-Apple-Watch-Sport-Band" class="headerlink" title="Nike Apple Watch Sport Band"></a>Nike Apple Watch Sport Band</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OdlXe5RELW0?si=Iz1H1QnLQVw-Eu3e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-classic-Apple-Watch-band-alternative"><a href="#Best-classic-Apple-Watch-band-alternative" class="headerlink" title="Best classic Apple Watch band alternative"></a>Best classic Apple Watch band alternative</h3><p>Nike’s flagship sports band is the athletic brand’s take on the classic Apple sports band.

Often, Apple Watch bands from third-party brands are sized according to the display size of your watch, such as 40mm, 45mm, 49mm, etc, but they are not necessarily your watch model. Some bands may also have wrist-size options, such as Apple’s flagship sport bands, which are S&#x2F;M and M&#x2F;L, but other options don’t specify wrist sizes (they ensure adjustability for a great fit). Be sure you know what band size and potentially what wrist size you need.</li><li><strong>Durability</strong>: A purchase is hardly worth it if your Apple Watch band breaks or cracks, so it’s important to consider the long-term durability while searching for watch bands. We don’t want you to waste your cash on cheap options, so we’ve tested the picks on this list before recommending them.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: As with other purchases, what you’re willing to spend is critical. Establishing a budget can help narrow down your search parameters and ensure you’re purchasing within your comfort range. Keep in mind that the material will often drive the cost of Apple Watch bands up. Several metal band options on this list, particularly the titanium options, are over $100.</li><li><strong>Comfort:</strong> If you’re purchasing a watch band, you might want it to be comfortable. When I tested watch bands over the last several months, I considered comfort on my own wrist before recommending anything on this list. Your watch band must be secure, too, especially if you’re using your watch during intense workouts or for heart rate monitoring.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mK1lEBRm_1w?si=FSaM0OKO0XBCgjtT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-did-we-test-these-best-Apple-Watch-bands"><a href="#How-did-we-test-these-best-Apple-Watch-bands" class="headerlink" title="How did we test these best Apple Watch bands?"></a>How did we test these best Apple Watch bands?</h2><p>We went hands-on with every Apple Watch band on this list before selecting and recommending our picks. I conducted hands-on testing over several months on over a dozen watch bands and incorporated even more analysis and hands-on testing  staff. </p><p>We spent time wearing these bands in our day-to-day lives, during work, errands, workouts, and more to get a feel for each band’s comfort, security, adjustability, and more – not just for a day or two, but over the course of a few weeks to really get a feel for each product’s add-in value. Can you “add” this product into your life and benefit from its presence, or is it just another fad product that’s too good to be true or collects dust after the buzz wears off? </p><p>If we think another product is worth your money, we’ll update this list or write up a spotlight review highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it’s for. </p><p>Plus, we routinely scour the web for new products worthy of testing, follow news on product rollouts and upgrades, and source the best deals. We know buying anything in the current economy is not just for your whims, and that’s why this list, as well as our other advice, is tailored to your needs, wants, and budget. Our picks are expert-tested and expert-vetted. </p><h2 id="How-do-I-know-what-size-Apple-Watch-band-to-buy"><a href="#How-do-I-know-what-size-Apple-Watch-band-to-buy" class="headerlink" title="How do I know what size Apple Watch band to buy?"></a>How do I know what size Apple Watch band to buy?</h2><p>Before buying the best Apple Watch band for your Apple Watch, you need to know which size to buy. If you are not sure, Apple provides a convenient <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/shop/Catalog/US/Images/bxxd/size-guide%5FCA.pdf" >sizing template <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you can use to check sizing. However, most bands today from non-Apple brands are adjustable and customizable for fit, so the band size isn’t of consideration. I only needed to remove links for the metal options I tested the last few months – for every other band option, I could self-adjust easily. </p><p>The most important factor is to confirm that your Apple Watch works with your chosen band to ensure a seamless fit when putting the two together. This means if you have a 49mm watch, you want to look for a band that specifies that size. Essentially, just know what model and display size you purchased for your watch, and you’ll be okay. </p><h2 id="How-much-do-the-best-Apple-Watch-bands-cost"><a href="#How-much-do-the-best-Apple-Watch-bands-cost" class="headerlink" title="How much do the best Apple Watch bands cost?"></a>How much do the best Apple Watch bands cost?</h2><p>The cost of Apple Watch bands can run the gamut, ranging from around $30 to upwards of hundreds of dollars. Many metal bands can easily bring you into the hundreds – Nomad’s titanium band is a whopping $300, and iterations of Apple’s Milanese Loop can get pricey, too. However, most of the picks on this list are under $100 and sit comfortably between the $30-$80 range.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aG3NRuHrIJg?si=HwzwD0RXmrzIXX1V" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-the-different-Apple-Watch-bands-available-from-Apple"><a href="#What-are-the-different-Apple-Watch-bands-available-from-Apple" class="headerlink" title="What are the different Apple Watch bands available from Apple?"></a>What are the different Apple Watch bands available from Apple?</h2><p>Apple offers several band options that are included with its watches, some dependent on the model purchased.

However, the USB-C charging, the action button, or new camera features may make the upgrade worthwhile. If you’re trying to decide, read on to learn why you should upgrade or why it may be worth holding off until the iPhone 17.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zWYVKFk3yPQ?si=Yu7xsjIYgRiq8zHk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Features</strong></th><th><strong>iPhone 16 Pro</strong></th><th><strong>iPhone 14 Pro</strong></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Starting price</strong></td><td>$999</td><td>$800</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Display</strong></td><td>6.3-in Super Retina XDR OLED</td><td>6.1-in Super Retina XDR OLED</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>199 g (7 oz)</td><td>206 g (7.3 oz)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Apple A18 Pro</td><td>Apple A16</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>8 GB</td><td>6GB</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</td><td>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Battery</strong></td><td>3,355 mAh</td><td>3,200 mAh</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Camera</strong></td><td>48MP Wide | 12MP Tele</td><td>48MP UW</td><td>12MP Selfie</td><td>48MP Wide | 12MP Tele</td><td>12MP UW</td><td>12MP Selfie</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0pSRlspzW-A?si=A82G3Yxwj_31cKDq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-iPhone-16-Pro-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-iPhone-16-Pro-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the iPhone 16 Pro if…"></a>You should buy the iPhone 16 Pro if…</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7fATC_lI7o?si=UFotPJqflDRZr-mv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-You-want-Apple-Intelligence"><a href="#1-You-want-Apple-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="1. You want Apple Intelligence"></a>1. You want Apple Intelligence</h3><p>Apple’s artificial intelligence push, aptly named Apple Intelligence, will be available over the coming months on the iPhone 16 lineup, but it’s not coming to the iPhone 14 Pro. Though the iPhone 14 Pro will get iOS 18, it’ll soon be short on AI features, rendering it outdated. If you’d like to stay up-to-date with the latest AI features or already use other AI tools in your day-to-day life, the iPhone 16 Pro is likely a worthy upgrade.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-hands-on/" >iPhone 16 Pro hands-on: My 3 favorite things about this ridiculously overpowered supercomputer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>To run smoothly, the Apple Intelligence features require an A17 chip or newer and at least 8GB of RAM, but the iPhone 14 Pro has the A16 chip and only 6GB of RAM. The iPhone 16 Pro features an A18 Pro chip and 8GB of RAM, making it a good device to run Apple’s AI features. </p><h3 id="2-You’d-like-to-get-your-hands-on-the-bigger-screen"><a href="#2-You’d-like-to-get-your-hands-on-the-bigger-screen" class="headerlink" title="2. You’d like to get your hands on the bigger screen"></a>2. You’d like to get your hands on the bigger screen</h3><p>Apple has thinned out the iPhone 16 Pro’s bezels to the bare minimum and stretched the Pro models’ displays to 6.3 and 6.9 inches for the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, respectively. This gives users more screen real estate to watch videos, play games, view and edit documents, and read shared screens on video conferences.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-compared-which-iphone-should-you-buy-today/" >Every iPhone 16 model compared: Which iPhone should you buy today? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The larger smartphone also means that the iPhone 16 Pro has a larger battery than the 14 Pro, at 3,355 mAh compared to 3,200 mAh. But even without the welcome battery upgrade, the new Pro models support faster charging than ever. The iPhone 16 Pro supports 40W wired charging and 20W of MagSafe charging, so if you find the iPhone 14 Pro’s charging slow, it could be time to upgrade.</p><h3 id="3-You-love-taking-beautiful-photos"><a href="#3-You-love-taking-beautiful-photos" class="headerlink" title="3. You love taking beautiful photos"></a>3. You love taking beautiful photos</h3><p>The iPhone 16 Pro features some of the best camera enhancements, including the improved ultrawide camera. The UW camera moved to align with a larger, improved Sony sensor, so it’s going from a measly 12MP to 48MP. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-demoed-apples-standard-iphone-16-and-didnt-envy-the-pro-models-at-all/" >I demoed Apple’s standard iPhone 16 and didn’t envy the Pro models at all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If you love taking photos with your smartphone, the camera upgrades alone may be enough to upgrade to an iPhone 16 Pro. The optical zoom is now 5x, an upgrade from the iPhone 14 Pro’s 3x zoom. The iPhone 16 Pro will also feature Apple’s new capture button, which lets you control the camera with gestures, like moving your finger and tapping the touch-enabled button. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Pre-order the iPhone 16 Pro View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="You-should-buy-or-keep-the-iPhone-14-Pro-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-or-keep-the-iPhone-14-Pro-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy (or keep) the iPhone 14 Pro if…"></a>You should buy (or keep) the iPhone 14 Pro if…</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><h3 id="1-You’d-rather-wait-for-bigger-upgrades"><a href="#1-You’d-rather-wait-for-bigger-upgrades" class="headerlink" title="1. You’d rather wait for bigger upgrades"></a>1. You’d rather wait for bigger upgrades</h3><p>Even with the Apple Intelligence features, the iPhone 16 seems to be an incremental design change rather than a revamp; the design and functionality aren’t a radical departure from the iPhone 14 Pro. If you’re content with the look, feel, and performance of your iPhone 14, getting the iPhone 16 Pro likely won’t feel like a huge upgrade, especially since many of the AI features will come months after you get the device.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-pro-packs-a-lot-more-innovation-for-the-same-price-as-last-year/" >iPhone 14 Pro review: More innovation for the same price as the iPhone 13 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/12/iphone-16-new-features-worth-the-wait/" >Rumors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suggest the iPhone 17 may feature more dramatic design and functionality updates, making it a worthwhile jump. Besides, upgrading after two generations can be costly, which brings me to my next point. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1dR4tF3VgyU?si=AJipgqZsNNxsRsBW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-You-just-finished-paying-it-off"><a href="#2-You-just-finished-paying-it-off" class="headerlink" title="2. You just finished paying it off"></a>2. You just finished paying it off</h3><p>One of the biggest reasons to hold off on an upgrade is financial. The iPhone 14 Pro started at $900 at launch, which isn’t pocket change. Most buyers choose a 12-, 18-, or 24-month financing option through a carrier or Apple on a new iPhone. If you’re one of them and just finished paying off your iPhone 14 Pro and feel like you’re not financially ready to commit to another payment plan, it may be worth passing on the new iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-just-gave-me-a-compelling-reason-to-buy-the-smaller-iphone-16-pro-over-the-max-this-year/" >Apple just gave me a compelling reason to buy the smaller iPhone 16 Pro over the Max this year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>As an iPhone 14 Pro Max user, I’m still pretty happy with how my iPhone performs, its battery life, and charging time. While USB-C charging would be convenient, I don’t see myself springing for the new iPhone 16 Pro, though I may go for the iPhone 17 when it’s launched.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BN95FRW9/ref=asc_df_B0BN95FRW91727089200000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B0BN95FRW9&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C90a08067-ba6a-4e09-b56a-0e5a5445e3ce%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >iPhone 14 Pro (Pre-owned) $627.45 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HaM818fFKXQ?si=ZZLA4lFSHSgCpSE0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Alternatives-to-consider"><a href="#Alternatives-to-consider" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to consider"></a>Alternatives to consider</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-15-pro-128gb-natural-titanium-verizon/6525473.p?skuId=6525473&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >BEST iPHONE ALTERNATIVE iPhone 15 Pro While the iPhone 15 Pro is a year old, it will also support Apple Intelligence and starts at $900.

This setting only exists if you have <strong>Share iPhone &amp; Watch Analytics</strong> enabled. If it’s not enabled, you’ll need to enable it and wait a day or so for the iPhone to collect the data.</p><p>Yes, the information is only logged if you choose to share it with Apple.

With this in mind, I’m quite surprised that it has only been through 163 recharge cycles, which means I’m on track for about 217 recharge cycles during the first year of ownership.</p><p>But how many recharge cycles can the battery endure before Apple considers it worn?</p><p>This is where I got another surprise!</p><p>According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/batteries/service-and-recycling/" >Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the battery in the Apple Watch “is designed to retain up to 80 percent of its original capacity at 1000 complete charge cycles.” That’s twice the number of charge cycles that the iPhone can do and still retain 80 percent of its charge capacity.</p><p>That means the battery is good for at least 3.5 to 4 years, which is pretty impressive. </p><h4 id="More-how-tos"><a href="#More-how-tos" class="headerlink" title="More how-tos"></a>More how-tos</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-download-youtube-videos-for-free-plus-two-other-methods/"  title="How to download YouTube videos for free, plus two other methods">How to download YouTube videos for free, plus two other methods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ditch-the-wi-fi-how-to-add-a-wired-network-to-your-home-without-ethernet-cable/"  title="Wi-Fi problems?

Our phones go everywhere with us, but just like our keys, they can get lost. Luckily losing your data along with your phone is avoidable. </p><p>There are two easy ways to back up your iPhone: a cloud service, like <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/icloud/&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iCloud <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage" >OneDrive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or your computer. Both methods have their pros and cons. The easier one may be backing up to a cloud service because it only requires one device: your phone. Backing up to the cloud, unfortunately, limits you to how much data you can store with that cloud. </p><p>Using a computer to back up your phone won’t cost you a monthly iCloud membership, but your data is stored on a hard drive, which means it’s only safe while the computer is safe. </p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Here’s-how-to-back-up-your-iPhone-with-iCloud"><a href="#Here’s-how-to-back-up-your-iPhone-with-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Here’s how to back up your iPhone with iCloud"></a>Here’s how to back up your iPhone with iCloud</h2><h3 id="Step-1-Go-to-settings-and-tap-on-your-name-at-the-top"><a href="#Step-1-Go-to-settings-and-tap-on-your-name-at-the-top" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Go to settings and tap on your name at the top"></a>Step 1: Go to settings and tap on your name at the top</h3><p>Image: Maria Diaz &#x2F; ZDNet</p><p>This option gives you access to your Apple ID, iCloud, and Purchases settings. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/djPqRkskaBo?si=O6FEI-KVW0HwN417" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-2-Tap-on-iCloud"><a href="#Step-2-Tap-on-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Tap on iCloud"></a>Step 2: Tap on iCloud</h3><p>Image: Maria Diaz &#x2F; ZDNet</p><h3 id="Step-3-Go-to-iCloud-Backup"><a href="#Step-3-Go-to-iCloud-Backup" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Go to iCloud Backup"></a>Step 3: Go to iCloud Backup</h3><p>Image: Maria Diaz &#x2F; ZDNet</p><h3 id="Step-4-Enable-iCloud-Backup-and-select-Back-up-Now"><a href="#Step-4-Enable-iCloud-Backup-and-select-Back-up-Now" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Enable iCloud Backup and select Back up Now"></a>Step 4: Enable iCloud Backup and select Back up Now</h3><p>Image: Maria Diaz &#x2F; ZDNet</p><p>Tap on the toggle to enable iCloud backups, and <strong>Back Up Now</strong> will appear, select that, and your phone should start backing up to iCloud.</p><p>5GB is not enough for a lot of us, especially if you’ve never backed up your iPhone.

And for the most part, that’s exactly what’s happened with the OnePlus Pad. </p><p>This Android-powered tablet has month-long battery standby, along with impressive daily battery life. Cipriani reviewed this tablet and found it quick and snappy for daily tasks like checking your email, playing games or browsing the web, all on a display that looks fantastic. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/oneplus-pad-review/"><strong>OnePlus Pad</strong></a></p><p>“One aspect of the overall experience I enjoyed using was the multitasking features built into OxygenOS, the operating system the Pad runs, Cipriani wrote. “More specifically, I found myself frequently using a quick gesture on the display to effectively split the display in half, putting one app on the left side of the screen and a second on the other half. A two-finger swipe down from the top of the screen was all it took.”</p><p>OnePlus also sells a keyboard case and a stylus for the OnePlus Pad, which more or less turns the OnePlus Pad into an iPad Pro dupe. However, verified customers who have bought and used this tablet say online that trackpad gestures and navigation are finicky, and a lot of the same interface features – such as the mouse pointer – on the OnePlus Pad come straight from Apple’s iPadOS interface for the same feature. </p><p><strong>OnePlus Pad specs: Display</strong>: 11.61-inch, 144Hz refresh rate, LCD 2,800x2,000 display | <strong>Processor</strong>: MediaTek Dimensity 9000 Mobile Platform | <strong>Storage</strong>: 128GB | <strong>Memory</strong>: 8GB | <strong>Colors</strong>: Halo green | <strong>Cameras</strong>: 13MP rear. 8MP front camera | <strong>Weight</strong>: 555 grams | <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 189.41 x 258.03 x 6.54mm | <strong>Connections</strong>: USB-C | <strong>Battery:</strong> 9,510mAh</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09KP9KCLS/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ce15219f5-3614-465e-b1d1-81d4610cbbfc%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/microsoft-surface-go-3-10-5-touch-screen-intel-pentium-gold-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-device-only-latest-model-platinum/6478762.p?skuId=6478762&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-go-3/904H27D0CBWN/2L0C?OCID=AID2200065" >View now at Microsoft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Windows Hello</li><li>Lots of ports</li><li>Up to 256GB storage</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Can only install apps from Microsoft Store in Windows 10 S Mode</li></ul><h2 id="Microsoft-Surface-Go-3"><a href="#Microsoft-Surface-Go-3" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft Surface Go 3"></a>Microsoft Surface Go 3</h2><h3 id="Best-compact-Windows-tablet"><a href="#Best-compact-Windows-tablet" class="headerlink" title="Best compact Windows tablet"></a>Best compact Windows tablet</h3><p>The design hasn’t changed for the Go 3, meaning it should work with all of the original accessories, including the Type Cover keyboard.

You move it by double tapping in the blank space on either side of it.”</p><p>Not only is the app experience better with the Pixel Tablet, but it pulls double duty acting as a smart home hub when it’s not in use thanks to the included Charging Speaker Dock. The $129 accessory (if you want to buy extras) has a built-in speaker that ups the bass by 4x, while enabling a hub mode feature that effectively makes the Pixel Tablet more like a Nest Hub, instead of a tablet. </p><p>Unfortunately, right now, there isn’t any sort of official keyboard or stylus for those who want to get some work done on the Pixel Tablet.

The Kindle Scribe also comes with preset templates to help you create notebooks, journals, and lists, and you can create sticky notes in Microsoft Word and other compatible Word documents. </p><p><strong>Review: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-kindle-scribe-review/" >Amazon Kindle Scribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>ZDNET contributing writer Matthew Miller went hands-on with the Kindle Scribe and called it “close to perfect.” “I use my Kindle Scribe daily as my primary note-taking device, and the habit of carrying it has also resulted in me reading more books than I have in years,” Miller wrote. “It’s an excellent ebook device while also serving as a capable working tablet.”</p><p>The Kindle Scribe comes with the Basic pen but verified Amazon customers say it’s best to opt for the $30 premium pen so you get more advanced features like a dedicated eraser and the shortcut button.</p><p><strong>Amazon Kinde Scribe tech specs:</strong> <strong>Display:</strong> 10.2-inch 300 ppi Paperwhite display | <strong>Storage:</strong> 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB | <strong>Weight:</strong> 15.3 ounces | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 7.7 x 9.0 x .22 inches | <strong>Connections:</strong> Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB-C | <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 12 weeks (at 30 minutes per day)</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLGKZCK3/ref=asc_df_B0BLGKZCK31726916400000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B0BLGKZCK3&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ce15219f5-3614-465e-b1d1-81d4610cbbfc%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Kids edition has many perks</li><li>Easy to use</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Performance will be an issue</li><li>Amazon’s Appstore is hit or miss</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PUDdKOsEN74?si=tkZf-KVinjuwmgx9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Amazon-Fire-HD-8-Kids-Tablet"><a href="#Amazon-Fire-HD-8-Kids-Tablet" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Tablet"></a>Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Tablet</h2><h3 id="Best-tablet-for-kids"><a href="#Best-tablet-for-kids" class="headerlink" title="Best tablet for kids"></a>Best tablet for kids</h3><p>Amazon just updated this tablet model in 2022, making it faster and with a longer battery life.

But Amazon does offer you a two-year worry-free guarantee in case the tablet does succumb to playtime.</p><p><strong>Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids tech specs: Display:</strong> 8-inch display | <strong>Processor:</strong> Hexa-core 2.0 Ghz | <strong>Storage:</strong> 32GB or 64GB (expandable by up to 1 TB) | <strong>Memory:</strong> 2GB | <strong>Colors:</strong> Blue, purple, Disney Mickey Mouse, or Disney princess <strong>| Cameras:</strong> 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording | <strong>Weight:</strong> 18.3 ounces | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 8.7 x 7.1 x 1.1 inches| <strong>Connections:</strong> 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C port | <strong>Battery life:</strong> 13 hours</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DxUX4R6Cf7c?si=prHevNQJivSkIfUt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-the-best-tablet"><a href="#What-is-the-best-tablet" class="headerlink" title="What is the best tablet?"></a>What is the best tablet?</h2><p>After going hands-on with all of these tablets, the 10th-generation iPad is our pick for the best tablet.

Its fairly affordable price tag also makes it a great choice for students who need a mobile work computer. </p><p>If you want to see quickly how the 10th-generation iPad specifically compares to the other tablets that made our list, see the handy chart below that compares factors like price, storage, and display size. </p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Tablet</strong></th><th><strong>Price</strong></th><th><strong>Display size</strong></th><th><strong>Storage</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple iPad (10th gen)</td><td>$349</td><td>10.9 inches</td><td>Up to 256GB</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon Fire HD 10</td><td>$150</td><td>10.1 inches</td><td>Up to 512GB with microSD card</td></tr><tr><td>Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</td><td>$1000</td><td>14.6 inches</td><td>Up to 1TB with microSD card</td></tr><tr><td>OnePlus Pad</td><td>$480</td><td>11.6 inches</td><td>128 GB</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft Surface Go 3</td><td>$450</td><td>10.5 inches</td><td>Up to 256GB</td></tr><tr><td>Apple iPad Pro (7th gen)</td><td>$999</td><td>11 or 13 inches</td><td>Up to 2TB</td></tr><tr><td>Google Pixel Tablet</td><td>$499</td><td>10.95 inches</td><td>Up to 256GB</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Gen iPad Air (6th gen)</td><td>$600</td><td>11 or 13 inches</td><td>Up to 1TB</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon Kindle Scribe</td><td>$390</td><td>10.2 inches</td><td>16GB, 32GB, or 64GB</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids</td><td>$150</td><td>8 inches</td><td>32GB or 64GB</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Which-is-the-right-tablet-for-you"><a href="#Which-is-the-right-tablet-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Which is the right tablet for you?"></a>Which is the right tablet for you?</h2><p>The biggest question you’ll need to answer about any tablet purchase is what you plan on using it for: Do you just want something to read a comic book and binge on some Netflix shows while you walk on the treadmill?

Some are better for kids, others are simply for artists, and then there’s the mini laptop for working professionals and students. We considered a variety of use-cases to match virtually every need.</li><li><strong>Price points:</strong> Tablets are an expensive piece of tech, especially if you’re planning on investing in compatible accessories or buying for your kids to inevitably drop at a moment’s notice,</li><li><strong>Integrations with other products:</strong> We considered options that can work with a smart case, attachable keyboard, Apple Pencil, or Stylus, and other work and entertainment add-ons.</li><li><strong>Battery life:</strong> Whether you’re using your tablet for work or play (or both), you’ll want it to last the duration of your task.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wy0uYNNdMDM?si=5ir7EHlr0CkpcYOT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-we-test-tablets"><a href="#How-we-test-tablets" class="headerlink" title="How we test tablets"></a>How we test tablets</h2><p>The ZDNET team chose all of the tablets included in this list based on their performance when <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tested in the real world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.</p><ul><li><strong>Display</strong>: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy.<br>We also compare the display’s performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen’s responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer’s stylus.</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet’s temperature during intensive tasks.</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong>: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.</li><li><strong>Camera and audio:</strong> For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.</li></ul><p>For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tablet testing methodology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><h2 id="What-does-it-mean-if-a-tablet-is-Wi-Fi-only"><a href="#What-does-it-mean-if-a-tablet-is-Wi-Fi-only" class="headerlink" title="What does it mean if a tablet is Wi-Fi only?"></a>What does it mean if a tablet is Wi-Fi only?</h2><p>When a tablet says it is “Wi-Fi Only,” it requires a wireless internet connection to access things like email, websites, and apps. There are models available that give you the option to use LTE cellular data to connect to the internet, but if you aren’t planning on traveling with your tablet, you can stick to a Wi-Fi only model.</p><h2 id="Is-a-tablet-better-than-a-laptop"><a href="#Is-a-tablet-better-than-a-laptop" class="headerlink" title="Is a tablet better than a laptop?"></a>Is a tablet better than a laptop?</h2><p>That depends on what you want to use your tablet or laptop for. Digital artists tend to prefer tablets since they’re easier to draw on with a stylus. Tablets are also great for photo editing and streaming movies if you get one with a large enough screen size. But if you want to do things like create spreadsheets, type in a word processing program, or do intensive 3D animation or modeling, you’re better off with a laptop.</p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-tablet-for-students"><a href="#What-is-the-best-tablet-for-students" class="headerlink" title="What is the best tablet for students?"></a>What is the best tablet for students?</h2><p>Our top pick for the best tablet for students is the 10th-generation iPad, thanks to its affordable price and versatility of use.
